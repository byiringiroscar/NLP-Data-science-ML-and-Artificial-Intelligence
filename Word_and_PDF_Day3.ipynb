Ferdinand Wanyonyi. \\n \\n\\nPUBLICATION OF REGULATIONS ON PRIVATE \\n\\nLAND USE AND MANAGEMENT \\n\\n \\nHon. Ferdinand Wanyonyi (Kwanza, FORD-K): Hon. Speaker, I beg to give Notice \\n\\nof the following Motion:  \\n\\nTHAT, aware that Article 68(c)(i) of the Constitution of Kenya provides \\nfor the minimum and maximum holding acreages with respect to private land; \\ndeeply concerned, that with the high population growth and the demand for land \\nhas  resulted  in  the  excessive  transformation  of  land  into  an  economical  unit; \\nnoting that, at the same time, the number of people who own large tracts of land \\nwhich are not utilized optimally is ignorant of the fact that the Constitution in \\nArticle 60 states out the principles of the land policy which among other things \\nrequires that land in Kenya shall be held, used and managed in a manner that is \\nequitable, efficient, productive and sustainable.   \\n\\nThis  House,  therefore,  resolves  that  the  Government  enforces  Article  68(c)(i)  of  the \\nConstitution and Section 158 of the Land Act, 2012 and National Land Policy Sessional Paper \\nNo. 3 of 2009 on the maximum and minimum land holdings in Kenya through the publishing \\nof  the  rules  and  regulations  for  the  private  land  use  and  management  with  regard  to  the \\nminimum and maximum land holdings in Kenya.   \\n\\nThank you, Hon.

Speaker,  I  beg  to  give  Notice  of  the \\n\\nfollowing Motion:  \\n\\nTHAT, aware that education is a key enabler for national development \\nthrough  the  realisation  of  Kenya’s  Vision  2030  and  sustainable  development \\ngoals;  appreciating  the  invaluable  role  that  teachers  play  in  actualising  the \\nnational  goals  of  education  and  also  noting  that  a  conducive  working \\nenvironment \\nthe \\ndelocalisation  of  teachers  commenced  in  2018  by  the  Teachers  Service \\nCommission  (TSC)  immensely  disrupted  teachers’  lives,  lowered  teachers’ \\n\\nteachers  enhances  performance; \\n\\nrecalling \\n\\nthat, \\n\\nfor \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Speaker. \\nPursuant to the provisions of Standing Order No. 44(2) (a), I rise to give the following \\nStatement on behalf of the House Business Committee which met on Tuesday, 11th October \\n2022 in the afternoon following its formation to prioritise Business for consideration.  Members \\nwill recall that yesterday, Wednesday, 12th October 2022, in accordance with the provisions of \\nStanding Order 28, this House approved the calendar of the National Assembly for the regular \\nsessions of the First Session. Therefore, the House is now scheduled to proceed for its recess \\ntomorrow, Friday, 14th October 2022, and resume the regular Sittings on Tuesday, 25th October \\n2022. \\n \\nHon. Speaker, for the information of Members, during the recess, the Committee on \\nAppointments  is  expected  to  undertake  the  vetting  of  persons  who  are  nominated  to  the \\npositions of Cabinet Secretaries, Attorney-General and the Secretary to the Cabinet, and table \\nits Report on this matter when we resume regular Sittings. Further, the Committee on Selection \\nwill also consider the placement of Members in  the various parliamentary committees. This \\nwill, therefore, be a working recess for those of us who sit in the Committee on Appointments \\nand the Committee on Selection. I urge the House to be patient as these processes are ongoing \\nand take the opportunity of this short break, as we said yesterday, to connect or bond with our \\nfamilies and constituents.  Following the elections that we had, many  of us have not  had an \\nopportunity to go back to our constituencies and families. \\nFinally, the House Business Committee (HBC) will reconvene on 25th October 2022 to \\n \\nschedule the business for the week of resumption of the House. I now wish to lay this Statement \\non the Table of the House. \\n \\n \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\n\\n(Hon.

Speaker: Leader of the Majority Party. \\nHon. Kimani Ichung'wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Hon. Speaker, I beg to move the following \\n\\n \\n \\nMotion: \\n\\nTHAT,  acknowledging  that  the  East  Africa  Legislative  Assembly  (EALA)  is \\nestablished  under  Article  9  of  the  Treaty  for  the  Establishment  of  the  East  African \\nCommunity as one of the key organs and institutions of the Community responsible for \\nthe Community’s legislative matters; recognising that, Article 50 of the Treaty provides \\nfor  the  election  of  Members  of  EALA  by  respective  partner  States’  Legislatures  in \\naccordance with their parliamentary procedures for a term of five years; further aware \\nthat,  the  East  African  Legislative  Assembly  Elections  Act,  2011  contemplates \\nconclusion of the election of Members of a new Assembly to be within 90 days before \\nthe expiry of the term of the subsisting Assembly; noting that, the term of the current \\nEast African Legislative Assembly lapses on 17th December 2022; cognisant of the need \\nto urgently conclude the election process for the East African Legislative Assembly to \\ncommence transacting business of the East African Community; \\n\\nNow therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 9 of the Houses of \\n\\nParliament (Joint Sittings) Rules, the House resolves: \\n\\n1.  To establish a Joint Committee consisting of seven Members appointed \\nby  each  of  the  Houses  of  Parliament  to  undertake  the  functions \\ncontemplated  under  the  East  African  Legislative  Assembly  Elections \\n(Election of Members of the Assembly) Rules, 2017; \\n\\n2.  That  the following Members shall represent  the National  Assembly in \\n\\nthe Joint Committee: \\n\\n(a)  Hon. Wanjiku Muhia - Co-Chairperson \\n(b) Hon. John Mutunga Kanyuithia \\n(c)  Hon. Daniel Nanok Epuyo, \\n(d) Hon. Francis Sigei Kipyegon \\n(e)  Hon. Ruth Adhiambo Busia \\n(f)  Hon. (Dr.) Makali Mulu, CBS and  \\n(g) Hon. Sabina Chege, CBS \\n\\n3.  That the Offices of the Clerks of the Houses of Parliament shall provide \\nsecretariat  services  to  the  Joint  Committee  in  accordance  with  the \\nStanding Orders; and \\n\\n4.  That the Joint Committee shall report to the House within the timelines \\nstipulated in the East African Legislative Assembly Elections (Election \\nof Members of the Assembly) Rules, 2017. \\n\\n \\nAs I have stated in the Motion, the EALA is an independent legislative arm of our East \\nAfrican  Community  (EAC)  that  was  established  under  Article  9  of  the  EAC  Treaty.  As \\nMembers are aware and for the benefit of our new Members, we have nine Members who are \\nelected by  each partner  State. Kenya being  a partner State  in  the Community, we  will elect \\nthese nine Members. The purpose of this Joint Committee is to guide us through the process of \\nelecting  these  Members.  That  is  why  you  see  that  we  have  representation  from  across  the \\npolitical  divide,  representing  all  our  parliamentary  political  parties.  We  assume  that  the \\ninterests  of  the  non-parliamentary  political  parties  are  catered  for  under  our  coalitions. \\nHowever, the list of names that we have submitted have representation from all parliamentary \\npolitical parties. \\nEALA plays a very critical role in furtherance of the EAC objectives such as liaising \\n \\nwith the National Assemblies of the partner States on matters relating to the Community. It \\nalso debates and approves the Budget of the Community. It also considers the annual Reports \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c13th October 2022                       NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               4 \\n\\non the activities of the Community, annual audit reports and any other report. It also discusses \\nall matters regarding the Community and makes recommendations, as it may deem necessary, \\nfor the implementation of the Community treaty. \\n \\nRule 9 of the Houses of Parliament for Joint Sittings, as  I said,  establishes the Joint \\nCommittee by way of a Motion which we have just tabled. It consists of membership from both \\nHouses. This list that we are approving here is that of the National Assembly. The other House \\nwill also have its list. That is why we have designated Hon. Wanjiku Muhia who is not only a \\nranking Member of the House but she is also an immediate former Member of EALA. So, she \\nis very well-versed with the affairs of EALA and the provisions of the EAC Treaty, and what \\nneeds to be done. \\n \\nAs I mentioned earlier, the term of the fourth Assembly that Hon. Wanjiku Muhia and  \\nHon. Jematiah, who is also here, are Members comes to an end on 17th December this year. \\nThe fifth Assembly is expected to commence its sittings early in 2023. Therefore, Members \\nknow that the Parliament of Kenya is required to conduct the election of its Members to EALA \\nlatest by 17th December 2022. However, the elections were not carried out immediately as the \\n12th Parliament ended on 10th June. Members remember that we took our sine die adjournment \\nin June. We could not carry out the elections for the Members who would have replaced the \\noutgoing ones. Therefore, this 13th Parliament is required to conclude this process urgently for \\nthe EALA to commence transacting its business, and avoid the scenario that we witnessed in \\nthe last elections of the Members of the Assembly in 2017. We are within time. However, it is \\nvery  important  to  establish  this  Committee,  before  we  go  on  recess  from  tomorrow.  As  the \\nother  two  Committees—Committee  on  Appointments  and  Committee  on  Selection—  are \\nworking, they may also now reconstitute and begin to prepare the timetable and programme \\nthat will guide us to conduct the elections. They will also guide us on when they will advertise \\nfor the positions. The entire timetable is to enable us come back and elect our new Members to \\nEALA. With the passage of this Motion and that in the Senate, it may as well serve as a notice \\nto those who are out there. Nobody seated here is electable to EALA but I know many of our \\ncolleagues whom we were with in the 12th Parliament who are interested. They may as well be \\nnotified through the passage of this Motion that the process has begun and they can therefore \\nbegin their campaigns and they will be guided by the Committee.  \\n\\nWith those many remarks, I beg to move. I will ask the Leader of the Minority Party, \\n\\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi, to second this Motion.  \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): Hon. Speaker, I wish to second the Motion for \\nthe adoption of the six names to form part of the Joint Committee that will oversee election of \\nMembers to EALA.  \\n\\nWithout  belabouring  the  point,  we  cannot  get  the  importance  of  EALA  in  a  wider \\ncontext of our desire as East Africans to eventually end up within one political federation. It is \\ntherefore  in  our  interest  that  EALA  continues  to  play  its  rightful  role,  and  continues  to  get \\nstrengthened so that as East Africans, we will eventually bring down all artificial barriers that \\ndivide our people. \\n\\n It is also important that we go about these elections properly as envisaged by the East \\nAfrican Community Treaty. It is on record that previously, when we did not get it right, the \\ncourts had to intervene. Indeed, the East African Court of Justice in the Prof. Anyang Nyong’o’s \\ncase settled the matter of how to go about election of Members to EALA by respective partner \\nstates.  \\n\\nThis  House,  by  approving  these  names  this  afternoon,  will  have  played  its  part  in \\nensuring that we abide by the rules, treaty and by our own statute to ensure we end up with \\nnames of people who will be elected to EALA representing Kenya as a partner State.

They are Members who are well equipped and have the capacity \\nto steer this important process.  \\n\\nWithout further ado, I second. \\nHon. Speaker: They have written as Busia but I am told… Is it correct? \\nHon. Members: Yes.  \\nHon. Speaker: I was told to apologise for calling you Busia but, if it is your name, we \\n\\nwill then leave it there. \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon.  Members,  before  we  open  the  debate,  allow  me  to  acknowledge  the  following \\nvisiting schools who are seated in the Public Gallery. They are: St. Teresa’s Primary School, \\nKericho  County;  Karugia  Secondary  School,  Murang’a  County;  and  Katwala  Secondary \\nSchool,  Kitui  County.  I  would  also  like  to  acknowledge  Jabali  Christian  School,  Nairobi \\nCounty,  who  are  seated  in  the  Speaker’s  Gallery.  On  my  behalf,  and  that  of  the  House,  we \\nwelcome the visiting schools to Parliament.  \\n\\nThis matter is too important to truncate it that way. We will need  you to… As Hon. \\nWanjiku  Muhia  speaks,  we  have  Members  with  physical  challenges  who  sit  at  the  back. \\nSometimes your cards do not appear on the screen because of the sheer numbers. Like now, we \\nhave 78 Members but  only 20 appear. Other Members would walk  all the way to  lobby for \\nrecognition; but in the event any one of you wants to speak, you can send one of the Serjeant-\\nat-Arms to come and inform the Chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n (Applause) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Wanjiku, you can proceed. \\nHon. Wanjiku Muhia (Kipipiri, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me an \\nopportunity to speak to this very important Motion which happens to be my area of interest \\nsince I have just concluded my term as a representative in EALA.   \\n\\nKindly, allow me to appreciate the people of Kipipiri for electing me because this is my \\nMaiden Speech. They made a statement in this country that it is no longer about the big names, \\nmoney,  deep  state,  chiefs  or  nyumba  kumi  that  will  stop  the  voice  of  Wanjiku  to  vote  for \\nWanjiku. For that, I want to confirm to them that surely their vote was their choice as the saying \\ngoes “my vote, my choice.” I am ready to serve them considering that Kipipiri is one of the \\nleast developed possibly in the whole of Mt. Kenya.  \\n\\nSpeaking of roads, we have pathetic ones. We do not  have water. When it comes to \\nelectricity connectivity, we are lagging behind and are still in darkness in spite of us having \\nhad great leaders as representatives of Kipipiri.  \\n\\nDuring the campaigns, we saw contractors build roads day and night. And for the last \\none month, the roads which were moving very fast in construction are no longer going on. I do \\nnot know where they got the money then that is not available today.nHon. Speaker, the money \\nis not there anymore. I want to ask…  \\n \\nEALA. \\n \\nstand guided.  \\n \\n\\nHon. Wanjiku Muhia (Kipipiri, UDA):  Hon. Speaker, this is  my Maiden Speech.  I \\n\\nHon.  Speaker:  The  Hon.  Wanjiku  Muhia,  I  do  not  know  what  that  has  to  do  with \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c13th October 2022                       NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               6 \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Order Members. I would forgive you if you are coming to this House \\n\\n \\nfor the first time. You are not a new Member. \\n \\nHon.  Wanjiku  Muhia  (Kipipiri,  UDA):  Hon.  Speaker,  I  stand  guided.  I  was  on  a \\ncommercial break, although a regional break. However, I wanted to sneak a caution to Stainless \\nSteel Contractors to be faster in the roads that are really not moving in Kipipiri.  \\n\\nHaving  said  that,  let  us  support  the  Members  selected  in  handling  this  matter.  I  am \\nconfirming  to  this  House  that  I  am  aware  that  all  partner  states  in  the  region  have  already \\nconcluded the election of their Members. \\n \\nI also want to remind Members that in 2017, the partner state Kenya delayed the chance \\nfor EALA to start the activities by a whole six months. All other partner states had elected their \\nMembers, and only Kenya had not because of the political issues that we had. The treaty speaks \\nof quorum in the House in EALA. No business  can be transacted if a partner state does not \\nhave three Members present in the House. For that reason, EALA could not transact business \\nfor six months and Members really struggled. Therefore, let us fast track this. It is 90 days and \\naccording to EALA Act, Section 12, it requires the respective Parliaments to make their own \\nrules  of  conducting  the  election.  In  that  case,  I  want  to  commend  the  House  Business \\nCommittee (HBC) and your office Hon. Speaker for electing me as the Co-Chair.  \\n \\nMatters  of  the  region  are  very  pertinent  to  this  Community.  Once  this  election  is \\nconcluded, I urge this House to integrate with EALA. Many times we do serious business in \\nEALA such as the audit report. We do serious transactions there but we are not able to connect \\nwith  Parliaments in  partner States. Unlike other  countries like Uganda  and Kenya,  you will \\nfind an audit report has been tabled in the House and we have made serious recommendations. \\nA Member of this region or from Kenya for example was handling a certain institution like… \\nThat Member who is named and shamed and is supposed to take responsibility is appointed in \\nour partner State or even in Kenya to handle another very serious institution. This is because \\nthere is no linkage between EALA and the parliaments particularly in Kenya. So, with that I \\nsupport.  \\n \\nI know the process. We are headed to the fourth pillar of regional integration, just to \\nmention we are already with Custom Union, Common Market and we are almost handling the \\nMonetary Union. I want to inform the Members (although they may be aware) that we shall \\nsoon  have  one  currency  in  the  whole  region  of  East  Africa.  We  shall  not  have  Tanzania  or \\nUganda Shillings but a common currency. As Kenya, we are lobbying to have the Central Bank \\nof East Africa here in Kenya. So, these are matters of our interest as leaders or representatives \\nof the people. \\n \\nFinally, the fourth pillar is the political federation where we aspire to have one nation \\nin the whole region. For that reason, I want to urge Members as I conclude that as we do the \\nelection,  let  us  find  people  of  quality  who  can  transact  and  take  care  of  the  interests  of  our \\ncountry.  Kenya  has  been  accused  many  times,  Members  and  Hon.  Speaker,  to  be  the  only \\ncountry that sweeps the whole nine Members and brings in other nine new Members. As you \\nare aware, four of us are already elected in this House: Hon. Jematiah, Hon. Aburi, Hon. Oburu \\nin  the  Senate  and  myself.  Kenya  is  known  to  sweep  the  nine  Members  and  we  leave  no \\ninstitutional memory. If you look at Uganda and all other nations, you will find they leave 50 \\nper cent of Members. At least for this election let us leave a Member or two for institutional \\nmemory so that our interests are also taken care of. \\n \\nyou for appointing me. \\nHon. Speaker: Let us have the Member for Bondo, Dr. Ochanda.  \\n \\nHon. Gideon Ochanda (Bondo, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. As we discussed \\n \\nthe whole issue of placing our Members to EALA, I think there are one or two things that I \\n\\n With that, I thank you and I am humbled to be elected to chair this Committee. Thank \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Speaker, EALA is a parliament and in Arusha we also have the Secretariat of the \\nCommunity.  Apparently,  that  Community  executes  and  implements  a  lot  of  projects.  A  lot \\nmore of those projects are funded not from the Community but from outside. The point I am \\ntrying  to  bring  here  is  that  these  projects  apparently  are  executed  in  the  national  or  in  the \\nindividual  countries.  For  instance,  in  Kenya  we  have  had  many  of  the  projects  that  are \\ncommunity projects. They are implemented in Kenya but the implementation is done by our \\nown Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that we have.  \\n \\nIn the end Hon. Speaker,  you will realise that in  this House when we are coming to \\nCommittees, they only do the oversight role. Yet these projects that are implemented by the \\nEALA are hardly overseen by any of our Committees. Meaning that they go without oversight. \\nOn the other hand, EALA does not oversee them because the projects have been implemented \\nin individual countries. This is something that I want to believe that our House, this Parliament \\nand particularly your Chair, Hon. Speaker must get into. They invest quite a  lot of money that \\nis passed by the Community and all these projects are not overseen by any agency.  The EALA \\ndoes not oversee them, neither do our committees here in the House. There was a project that \\nwas in  Lake  Victoria  for purposes of removing  water hyacinth. That  thing is  moribund and \\nnobody can oversee it. \\n \\nThere  was  a  big  project  of  reforestation  that  was  being  done  by  our  Ministry  of \\nEnvironment; nobody oversaw that. There was another project in Kisii and parts of Bomet for \\nwater; large water projects that were being funded through the East African Community which \\nsuffered the same fate for lack of oversight.  The EALA cannot oversee them because they are \\nin  individual  countries.  On  the  other  hand,  we  cannot  oversee  them  because  the  source  of \\nfunding is from the secretariat in Arusha.  \\n\\nThe other thing I wanted to bring out is that EALA stands as the institution that we see \\nin  the  Community,  particularly  in  the  region.  However,  the  biggest  problem  we  have  is  the \\namounts of conflict we have across the individual countries and a lot of disharmony that we \\nhave,  many  times  between  Tanzania  and  Kenya  and  between  Uganda  and  Kenya.  Hardly  a \\nweek passes without having issues or incidences across Lake Victoria or Isebania in Migori. \\nLast week there were major issues because Kenya had not done certain things that on the hand \\nTanzania had done. Transport lorries were being cleared on the Tanzanian side but not on the \\nKenyan side. \\n \\nHon. Speaker as we look through this thing of EALA, we should not just look at it for \\npurposes of the East African Legislative Assembly constantly looking at the laws and the Bills \\nthat we have passed as part of the agenda. We need to have the agenda as part of these problems \\nwhich are the real issues hampering the effort of integration. Those are two critical things that \\nI wanted to bring around as we move towards electing our Members to EALA.  \\n\\nI thank you, Hon. Speaker.  \\nHon.  Speaker:  Thank  you  Hon.  Member  for  Bondo.  Let  us  have  the  Member  for \\n\\n \\nTigania East, Mpuru Aburi. \\nHon. Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East, NOPEU): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me \\n \\nthis opportunity to make my contribution. Let me begin by congratulating the President for the \\nmany issues which he said his Government will focus on in the next five years. One key issue \\ntouching my heart is that of pursuing transformation agenda which will include an overhaul of \\nthe security infrastructure in the country to make it more inclusive. Many Kenyans are facing \\nserious socio-economic hardships since the economic model we have has created a huge gap \\nbetween the poor and the rich. As we speak now, most parts of the country are facing starvation \\nand hunger due to prolonged drought. Two weeks ago…. \\n \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung’wah (Kikuyu, UDA): On a point of order, Hon.

Speaker: Yes please! There is a point of order from the Leader of the Majority \\n\\n \\nParty. \\nHon. Kimani Ichung’wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I do not want \\n \\nto interrupt my good friend Hon. Mpuru Aburi who is doing his third term. To begin with he \\nshould know that when I stand on a point of order, he should take his seat.  \\n\\nHon. Speaker: You will not be allowed. You will only debate the Motion but do not \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Member for Tigania East, you are an old Member of the House. The \\n\\nHon. Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East, NOPEU): Of course, I am an old Member of this \\n\\nHon. Mpuru is not helping our new Members. It is understandable when a new Member \\nreads  notes,  but  not  a  Member  who  is  serving  his  third  term  and  having  served  in  EALA \\nstanding in his place to read notes, which we do not know are from who or where. I think he is \\ncompletely  out  of  order  and  misleading  our  new  Members.  He  must  not  be  allowed  to  be \\nreading notes, unless he makes disclosure about the author of those notes. \\n \\nrules prohibit any Member from reading… \\n \\nHouse but allow me to read the statement because it is mine. \\n \\nread a rehearsed speech which is not part of the debate. \\n \\nhand because I stayed there for five years. \\nHon. Speaker: That is correct. \\n \\nHon. Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East, NOPEU): I want to say we have to support each \\n \\nother. There is no need of hating each other in this Parliament. Sometimes when the Leader of \\nthe Majority Party sees someone speaking, he says: ‘this man is not allowed to speak in this \\nParliament  because  he  has  stayed  here  for  three  terms.’  I  want  to  tell  him  he  is  very  lucky \\nbecause he got appointed. Do not forget we supported Azimio, and this time I am the Party \\nLeader of National Ordinary People Empowerment Union (NOPEU) Party and as I speak right \\nnow, we are supporting His Excellency the President of this country. \\n \\n \\n\\nHon. Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East, NOPEU): Yes, no problem I know EALA has my \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Member, are you done? Thank you. Hon. Robert Mbui. \\n \\nHon. Robert Mbui (Kathiani, WDM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for the opportunity \\n \\nto also contribute. I am surprised that one of our very close Members has just defected on the \\nFloor of the House, Hon. Mpuru Aburi. Yet, he was supporting us and fighting very strongly \\non our side. \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\nHon Speaker: Order, Hon. Members! Order! Order, Robert Mbui! Honestly, as your \\n \\nSpeaker I want to follow the debate. We can only do so if the conversations are in lower tones \\nthan  they  are  now.  The  East  African  Community  (EAC)  is  the  centre  piece  of  many  of  our \\nhearts. This is a very important Motion. I want to encourage that the quality of people you will \\nelect to EALA, must also be commensurate with the status of Kenya’s region super power. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nHon. Robert Mbui (Kathiani, WDM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. First, I want to begin \\n \\nby supporting what Hon. Wanjiku Muhia has raised. This is a matter of Kenya being the only \\ncountry which clearly removes every Member elected to EALA and elects new ones. I wanted \\nto say, for purposes… \\n \\n\\nHon. Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East, NOPEU): On a point of order, Hon. Speaker. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Speaker: There is a point of order from Hon. Mpuru. Can you give the Member \\n \\nfor  Tigania  East  the  microphone?    Hon.  Mpuru  put  your  card  in  and  press  the  intervention \\nbutton so I can give you the microphone. Hon. Aburi you may sit down and let Hon. Robert \\nMbui to continue. \\nHon.  Robert  Mbui  (Kathiani,  WDM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker.  It  looks  like \\n \\ntechnology is not in favour of my colleague so please, allow me to continue. He only wants to \\ncomplain because of a comment he made and I made reference to it. He said he was in Azimio \\nand now he is supporting His Excellency the President. So, he seems to have defected on the \\nFloor. If that is the issue, I think it is not that serious.  \\n \\nI  am  supporting  what  Hon.  Wanjiku  Muhia  has  said  about  maintaining  some  of  our \\nMembers. Hon. Speaker, following what you have said, that we need to have quality Members, \\nI  want  to  propose  when  we  start  discussing  those  Members  going  to  EALA,  we  have  good \\nquality people. We should have one for the institutional memory and people of quality. People \\nwith  degrees  in  Law  or  International  Relations  will  have  an  added  advantage.  Our  Wiper \\nnominee is one such person, Hon. Kennedy Kalonzo Musyoka, who is already in EALA. \\n \\n I want to mention two things about EALA which I think are important for Members to \\nknow.  First,  is  the  issue  of  partner  state  payments.  In  the  11th  Parliament,  I  was  in  the \\nCommittee on Regional Integration. We realised that many partner states do not  make their \\ncontributions for the Community to exist. As we send Members there, this is one of the issues \\npeople need to address. \\n \\nFinally, the Members of EALA who are here have not said this; that another problem \\nthey have is they have no place to call home when they come back to the country. The Members \\nof EALA fall under a Ministry, I think the Ministry of East African Community, yet these are \\nelected Members of Parliament. It is important we find a way so they can also be catered for \\nunder the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC). As they go there and come back, they are \\npart and parcel of the leadership of this nation because they are Members of Parliament. \\nHon. Speaker, with those few remarks, thank you and I support. \\n \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Member for Kanduyi. \\n \\nHon. John Makali (Kanduyi, FORD-K): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for granting me \\n \\nthis opportunity to address this House for the first time. It has been a long wait in the queue but \\nat least my time has come.  \\n\\nBefore I make my contribution to the Motion on the Floor of the House, let me take this \\nopportunity to thank the great people of Kanduyi for having elected me as their representative \\nin this Parliament. It was a long journey and not a walk in the park. I must say I relied on the \\nsupport of many Members of Parliament who came out to campaign for me together will all \\nthe Kanduyi people.  So, I say a big thank you.  \\n\\nHon. Speaker, at this juncture I must thank you most sincerely for being my mentor, \\nteacher and party leader and for the role you played in getting me to this august House. It was \\nnot an easy assignment to remove my predecessor who had served in this House for four terms; \\n20 years and the party leader of Democratic Action Party-Kenya (DAP-K). I must thank the \\npeople of Kanduyi for the favour they granted me to represent them in this House. \\n \\nTurning to the Motion before the House, we appreciate the role of EAC in development \\nmatters in this region. The EAC is a critical component in fostering international trade, regional \\ncooperation and issues touching on cross-border trade. I must say that the names that have been \\ngiven here will play a leading role in selecting Members who will be at EALA. I had occasion \\nto  visit  EALA,  and  I  will  say  without  contradiction  that  our  Members  who  were  there \\npreviously  did  not  reflect  critically  the  quality  of  Kenyans  who  are  representing  us  in  that \\nAssembly.  \\n\\nHon. Charity Chepkwony (Njoro, UDA): On a point of order, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: He is making his Maiden Speech. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c13th October 2022                       NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               10 \\n\\nHon. John Makali (Kanduyi, FORD-K): Having sat in that Assembly, I was worried \\nabout the people representing this country. I hope the Committee that has been put in place, as \\nhas been said by Members who have contributed before me, will be able to measure up to the \\nassignments that they will have and be able to reflect the true face of Kenya as they take up the \\nassignments in that Assembly. \\n\\n I wish to reiterate, as I join this Assembly, that we must work as a team so as to deliver \\non the agenda  for Kenyans. The agenda for  Kenyans is  basically  fighting  to  ensure that  we \\nreduce  the  cost  of  living  to  ensure  that  our  children  go  to  school,  our  mama  mbogas  and \\nbodabodas are able to earn a living. To this, I will support the Kenya Kwanza agenda that is \\ntowards ensuring that we establish the Hustler Fund that will be able to assist the mama mbogas \\nand the youth of this country to develop themselves and move up. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, I wish to reiterate that, as I come to the Floor of this House, three critical \\nissues  are  important  for  the  people  of  Kanduyi.  I  will  start  with  the  issue  of  Nzoia  Sugar \\nCompany. As we speak, the farmers have not been paid. There is no board of management at \\nNzoia Sugar from the year 2019. The sugarcane is rotting in farmer’s farms and their children \\nare not going to school. I will want the Head of State to do as he assured the people of Kanduyi \\nduring  the  campaigns  that  Nzoia  Sugar  Company  is  going  to  function  and  its  problems  are \\ngoing to be solved so that the people can have value for their sweat. \\n\\nWhen we move around Kanduyi Constituency, we have not been able to benefit from \\nthe last mile supply of electricity. As it was stated in the President’s Speech, we would be able \\nnot  only  to  ensure  that  electricity  reaches  each  and  every  corner  of  Kanduyi,  but  also  have \\naffordable  electricity  available  to  all  residents  of  Kanduyi  who  have  had  a  lot  of  faith  by \\nelecting me in this House. \\n\\nWe have heard from the President’s Speech that the issue of the National Government-\\nConstituencies  Development  Fund  (NG-CDF)  is  a  critical  Fund  that  has  helped  many  other \\npeople in our constituencies. I will be at the forefront to ensure that we team up with all the \\nother Members of this House to ensure that we ring-fence the CDF so that it assists our people \\nthe way it is expected to. \\n \\nI wish to state that a healthy nation is a wealthy nation. At this juncture, we would want \\nto ensure that the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) takes off and we ring-fence it from \\nany other assaults that were there by people who are siphoning funds from it. We must ensure \\nthat universal healthcare comes to fruition. \\n \\nFinally, Hon. Speaker, I wish to finish my remarks by stating the words of Henry Ford \\nthat  “coming  together  is  a  beginning,  working  together  is  progress,  and  keeping  together  is \\nsuccess.” In the prayer that we state here every day when we come to this House, we exist for \\nthe welfare of society and the just government of the people. We hope that we will be able to \\nrise to the occasion to ensure that we fulfil the promises made up to our people.  \\n\\nThank you, and I support. \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Member for Njoro, Hon Kathambi Chepkwony. \\nHon.  Charity Chepkwony (Njoro, UDA):  Thank  you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me \\nthis  opportunity.    Let  me  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  you  as  our  Speaker,  and  our \\nDeputy Speaker, our lady. I also thank every Kenyan for voting for our able President, William \\nSamoei Ruto. I also thank my people of Njoro Constituency for re-electing me as their Member \\nof Parliament. \\n\\nI stand to support the list. I wish to take a short time. Thank you. \\nHon. Speaker: That is all? Before Hon. Irene Mayaka, Nominated Member, takes the \\nFloor,  allow  me  to  recognise  the  presence  of  Ololetet  Primary  School  from  Narok  County \\nseated at the Public Gallery.  \\n\\nHon. Irene Mayaka (Nominated, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I wish to give my \\ncontribution to the Motion on the Table on the EALA representatives. I agree with the Members \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c13th October 2022                       NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               11 \\n\\nwho say that we need to be very careful in terms of the qualifications that we give the Members \\nand the ones that we bring on board. The reason being, right now one of the biggest issues, \\nwhen you look at some of the things that the EALA has been on is that, they face difficulties \\nin terms of ensuring that they have policies in place that cut across all our countries because \\nthe frameworks put in place are not usually very comprehensive. Mine is just to urge both sides \\nof  the  House  to  ensure  that  they  bring  Members  on  board  who  have  the  prerequisite \\nqualifications  so  that  we  do  not  have  Members  who  just  go  there  and  tick  boxes  instead  of \\ndoing the actual work.  \\n\\nI submit. Thank you. \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Member for Kamukunji. \\nHon. Yusuf Hassan (Kamukunji, JP): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for the opportunity. \\nSince it is my first time to speak in the 13th Parliament, I want to thank the wonderful people \\nof Kamukunji for bringing me to this august House. I want to pledge, as I have done before, to \\nwork for them humbly, respectfully and even harder for them in this Parliament. \\n\\nSpeaking  on  the  issue  of  EALA,  I  want  to  put  this  particular  issue  in  the  global, \\ninternational  and  regional  context  of  the  geopolitics  of  our  country.  The  East  African \\ncommunity is one of the most important regional institutions and perhaps one with the biggest \\npotential  in  bringing  together  the  people  of  the  region  not  only  in  terms  of  economic \\ncorporation but also eventually the main vision of the East African people to have East African \\npolitical federation. Knowing that in fact East Africa is our biggest trending partner and our \\nbiggest political allies and EALA has been an Assembly that legislates the laws of this region, \\nit is very important that we send the best minds that we have in this country.  I must say that \\nduring past elections of Members to EALA, unfortunately, the case has always been to push \\npeople who have been rejected politically, and to use the EALA as a garbage dump to get rid \\nof people who perhaps have not been selected for leadership positions in the country. \\n\\nThe EALA Members are the face of Kenya. We must send our best minds to push the \\nvision, mission and aspirations of East Africans.  If we send someone who has no clue other \\nthan the fact that they have been given a position of payment and privilege, we will be failing \\nin that objective.  \\n\\n I urge this House and the leadership of political parties and the country, to take this \\nmatter very seriously and send our best minds to represent us in the East African region, which \\nis a building block for the bigger vision of a united Africa that can play its role on the global \\narena. This is so that Africa can take its place in international politics, be heard as a continent, \\nand become players on the global stage.   \\n\\nThe EALA is just the beginning. It is the first step for us to assert the fact that we want \\na stronger economic and political East Africa. We then go to the African Union where we have \\na new trade agreement for the whole of Africa. The EALA will play an important role in that. \\nThat is why we should be very serious with regards to the people that we send there. It is not \\njust a job for the boys and girls. It is a job for people who can push us forward, put our name \\nup there and develop laws and legislation that will lift up the East African region, make it a \\nregional power in Africa and a major player in global affairs. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker:  Thank you. I will give an opportunity to Hon. Andrew Okuome. \\nHon. Adipo Okuome (Karachuonyo, ODM):  Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me \\n\\nthe opportunity.  \\n\\nThe  EALA  is  a  very  important  institution  for  member-States.  I  recall  when  the \\nmembership  only  covered  three  countries.  I  also  recall  when  Kenya  was  getting  its \\nIndependence and the East African Community was the hope of the three countries becoming \\na federation. That has disappeared into thin air, which is very disappointing. Because of this, I \\nwish that we elect people who can unite the whole of East Africa. All we see today is conflict. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It has been the cause of some of the \\nconflicts we have had with Uganda and Tanzania.   \\n\\nDo you remember Migingo Island? There are wars there most of the time. Some people \\ncome from Uganda, arrest our people, take them to Uganda and whatever they do with them, \\nonly God knows. We want people who can really look at the problems that we have as East \\nAfrican Community States and find a solution.  \\n\\nWe also need people who can unite us commercially. I heard our President speaking \\nwhen he met with his counterpart in Tanzania. He was crying for commercial unity in trade \\nand the East African currency that we used to have before the formation of the East African \\nCommunity (EAC).  Probably, that is one of the things that the current Community should fight \\nfor, so that we have one currency. That is what will also help us to ensure that trade in East \\nAfrican Community States is viable and that we have the East African Community of our hopes \\nand dreams, one that can move us from where we are and help us all in terms of trade and more \\nimportantly, politically.  \\n\\n We would like political unity. That is what I referred to earlier when I talked of the \\nfederation. When we have political unity, there are many other good things that we can achieve.  \\nWe can achieve so much if we are united.  I wholly believe that we will give our partners very \\nable Members to serve us in the EALA. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity. I hope that my dream will be \\n\\nkept alive by those who will go to the EALA. \\n\\nHon. Speaker:  Let us have the Member for Gilgil. \\nHon. Martha Wangari (Gilgil, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I also rise to support \\nthe nomination of these Members. This list is very well-thought-out. They know that they have \\ntheir work cut out for them in terms of the issues being raised at the EALA. Those who go there \\nmust know that they have to defend the position that Kenya holds in terms of our bilateral and \\nmultilateral relations in Africa and East Africa, specifically. I hope that the team will also look \\nat all matters as stipulated, in terms of balance and even getting new blood. Even as we make \\ndo with institutional memory, I hope that we also get new blood to take new ideas to the EALA.   \\n\\nHon. Speaker, EALA member-states should address the disputes that they have with \\ntheir  neighbours.  Let  us  deal  with  issues  of  Migingo,  trade  imbalances  between  us  and \\nTanzania,  herders,  maize  and  Maasais  across  the  two  countries.  We  have  had  issues  with \\nTanzania. I hope that these Members will defend the integrity of the boundaries of this country \\nand the position that Kenya holds. They hold the aspirations of all Kenyans. We should not \\nalways give in and become the underdog. I hope we can reclaim the position that Kenya holds \\nin the EALA and the EAC. \\n\\n  With those few remarks, I support the appointment of the Joint Committee. I hope that \\n\\nthis work will be expedited, so that we are able to deal with the timelines at the right time.   \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker:  Thank you. Let us have the Member for Kesses. Where is he? He is \\nnot here.  Let me give an opportunity to the Member for Malava who was soliciting for a chance \\nto speak. \\n\\nHon. Malulu Injendi (Malava, ANC): Thank you, Hon. Speaker.  I also rise to support \\nthe Committee members. I urge them to develop regulations that will guide the House when it \\ncomes to electing these persons.  \\n\\nI  recall  that  in  the  last  Parliament,  we  talked  of  regional  representation,  gender,  et \\ncetera. In the last Parliament, we voted for three persons from one community to the EALA. \\nWe almost voted for a fourth one were it not for an intervention indicating that we did not have \\ngender representation. I urge Hon. Wanjiku Muhia, who is very familiar with the case, to help \\nthis Parliament ensure that the persons we vote in represent the regional representation of the \\ncountry. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I \\nrecall  that  sometime  in  the  last  Parliament,  the  then  President  of  Tanzania,  the  late  Hon. \\nMagufuli, burnt 5, 000 of our chicks alive. I did not hear our representatives in EALA talking \\nabout  it.  He  took  away  1,000  cattle  from  us,  but  I  did  not  hear  any  voice  from  our \\nrepresentatives.  As  Hon.  Mbui  said,  we  need  to  elect  people  who  can  really  represent  our \\ninterests and speak about the ills affecting Kenyans. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. I support the appointment of the Members. \\nHon. Speaker: Thank you. Member for Bomachoge Borabu. \\nHon.  Nolfason  Barongo  (Bomachoge  Borabu,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker.  I \\nhave been looking forward to this particular address; it is the first one. I would like to support \\nthe appointment of the ad hoc Committee on election of Members to EALA. \\n\\nI thank God for the miracle of my election to this House. I am Hon. Nolfason Obadiah \\nBarongo, Member of Parliament for Bomachoge Borabu. My journey to this House is the stuff \\nof  dreams.  I  was  a  vegetable  vendor  before.  Now,  by  the  grace  of  God,  I  am  a  Member  of \\nParliament. It is a humbling and inspiring story for another day.  \\n\\nLike many Members who have spoken before me, I would like to congratulate you and \\nyour deputy on being elected the heads of this Assembly. I pray God to grant you good health \\nand wisdom as you lead us in the making of a better country. Allow me to profusely thank the \\npeople of Boochi, Bombamba, Magenche and Bokimonge wards for putting aside clanism and \\ncharting  a  new  path  of  unity  for  Bomachoge  Borabu;  and  they  did  so  emphatically  and \\npeacefully. I promise that I will serve them with diligence and humility. Let me also single out \\nmy  wife  and  children,  my  mother  and  father,  siblings  and  relatives,  many  friends  and  my \\ncampaign team full of young dreamers for pulling a memorable victory in this election. I thank \\nthe ODM party and my party leader, Hon. Raila Amolo Odinga, for issuing me with the ticket \\nthat helped me to be elected to this House. I cannot forget my worthy opponents, who did not \\npetition my election. To all of them, I would like to say thank you very much. \\n\\nYou may know that Bomachoge Borabu is one of the two Bomachoge constituencies \\nin Kisii County. The other being Bomachoge Chache represented by my brother Hon. Alfah \\nMiruka.  My  constituency  has  experienced  tribal  clashes  in  the  past  because  we  border  the \\nMaasai. Thankfully, peace has prevailed lately and business has been booming.  \\n\\nMy constituency boasts of a school called Riokindo High School. In last year’s Kenya \\nCertificate of Secondary Education (KCSE), a staggering 476 out of 485 scored C+ (plus) and \\nabove. Allow me to praise the headteacher, the staff, the community and, most importantly, the \\nstudents  for the excellent  results.  I had the opportunity of touring my  constituency over the \\nweekend. Some schools could be improved. A case in point is a school called Riabu, which has \\nbeen  a  beacon  of  education  in  my  constituency  for  a  long  time.  It  is  unthinkable  that  the \\nNational Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF) will not be available to \\nrescue such schools as Riabu that truly need much improvement. I will champion the elevation \\nof Kenyenya Polytechnic to a national polytechnic and the construction of Gesabakwa Institute, \\nso that students who cannot make it to university can pursue their careers there. \\n\\nIn the interest of time, I would like to sign off by saying how privileged I am to be the \\nrepresentative of the good people of Bomachoge Borabu and Kenyans at large. I hope that the \\ndiscussions we have here will be geared towards bettering the lives of our people.  \\n\\nThank you very much, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Owen Baya (Kilifi North, UDA): Thank you very much, Hon Speaker. First, I \\nwould like to support the appointment of the Committee and congratulate the proposed Co-\\nChair and all Members on being nominated to the Committee. \\n\\nHon.

Unless you anticipate to speak to the next Motion, you may decongest the screen \\nto help us in managing the queue. \\n\\nHon. Owen Baya (Kilifi North, UDA): I was congratulating the Committee.  We are \\nhonoured  as  a  country  today  to  host  the  Secretary-General  of  the  East  African  Community \\n(EAC), Mr. Peter Mathuki, who is also Kenyan. He is in the country with the Chief Justice of \\nthe East African Court of Justice (EACJ). \\n\\nAs this Committee gets down to work, there are very many important things that they \\nneed to do. We need to send a strong delegation to EALA. One onerous task of this Committee \\nis to ensure that they put together criteria that gives us the best.  \\n\\nI  acknowledge  what  my  brother  Hon.  Mbui  has  said  on  the  need  for  continuity  in \\nEALA. It is sad that this is the only country that sweeps everybody out and brings in a new \\nteam. When we get there as a country, we are disadvantaged because we have to start on a fresh \\npage. It is important that we retain one or two people in EALA. I do not want to campaign for \\nanyone, but it is very important that we retain some of them. I want to reiterate that we need to \\nsend quality representation to EALA. I think we had good representation in this Assembly and \\nwe look forward to having better and quality representation. When campaigns for EALA start, \\nit is a very exciting time. I want to urge new Members to stay in the lobby when the campaigns \\nstart. It is a very interesting time. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Order, Hon. Members. There is a point of order from Hon. Wangwe. \\nHon.  Emmanuel  Wangwe  (Navakholo,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker.  I  do  not \\nwant  to  interrupt  my  colleague  and  good  friend  the  Deputy  Majority  Leader.  I  rise  under \\nStanding  Order  83  as  read  together  with  Standing  Order  95.  Listening  to  Members’ \\ncontributions to this Motion and considering the importance of the next order, I move that the \\nMover be called upon to reply so that we move to the next order. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Thank you, Hon. Wangwe. I see quite a bit of interest on this Motion. \\nAfter Hon. Baya, I will give opportunity to three Members on either side then call the Mover \\nto reply. Members have been doing very well in terms of time; nobody has spoken for more \\nthan five minutes, which is very good. \\n\\nHon. Owen Baya (Kilifi North, UDA): I was telling new Members to stay in the lobby \\nto  listen  to  the  people  campaigning  so  that  we  elect  people  who  can  provide  quality \\nrepresentation.  Please  engage  them  well  as  they  campaign.  There  will  be  very  intense \\ncampaigns at the lobby. Please stay there so that we elect people of very good qualities. \\n\\nI want to ask the team that is going to do this job to do a good job for us as a country. \\nGive this country honour by ensuring that we elect people that deserve to be in that Assembly, \\nnot  just  because  your  party  has  said  that  you  must  be  elected.  This  House  must  make  the \\ndecision.  I  remember  during  the  last  EALA  election  it  was  about  what  a  party  had  said, \\nirrespective  of  whether  the  candidate  was  qualified  or  not.  The  party  said  and  followed  the \\nparty’s  decision.  This  time  round  we  need  to  scrutinise  everybody’s  curriculum  vitae  and \\nconsider the qualification of persons we are electing.  It  is  about  the  country.  It  is  not  about \\nparty or individuals. That is why this Committee is a joint Committee of the many parties. Let \\nus not look at which party is proposing who. Let us look at the quality of the persons. Most \\nimportantly, listen to the candidates when they come to campaign. I wish those who will come \\nto campaign well. I wish the Committee well as they do their job.  \\n\\nI thank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Oyula. \\nHon.  Joseph  Oyula  (Butula,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker,  for  giving  me  this \\n\\nopportunity to also contribute to this Motion. \\n\\n Hon.  Speaker,  let  me  start  by  congratulating  you  and  your  Deputy  for  having  been \\nelected to lead this House.  I also want to thank the people of Butula for giving me a second \\nchance to represent them in this House. Butula has been unfortunate in the past in that one is \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

This time, they gave me a second chance.  I sincerely thank them \\nand assure them that I will work with them very closely. \\n\\nAs for this Motion, I support the Committee that has been appointed. However, we need \\nto  make  sure  that  the  people  we  appoint  to  the  EALA  are  qualified  and  can  represent  our \\ncountry very well, particularly in trade between our country and the other partners.  The quality \\nof the people we appoint to EALA must be above board.  We need to make sure that Kenya is \\nwell represented and that Kenya appoints people who are going to lead the Community into \\nworking together for the benefit of the people of East Africa. \\n\\nThose of us who live along the Ugandan border know what it means to be together with \\nour  neighbours.    If  our  neighbours  are  not  cooperative,  we  might  not  have  peace  along  our \\nborders.  Because of bad blood, you can have people fighting over very small issues.  So, let \\nus have good representatives at EALA.  \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I thank you once more for giving me this opportunity and I \\n\\nthank the people of Butula for electing me for a second term. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Johana Ng’eno. Give him the microphone. \\nHon. Johana Kipyegon (Emurua Dikirr, UDA): Thank you very much, Hon. Speaker \\nfor giving me this opportunity to also ventilate on this issue on EALA.  From the outset, I have \\nno issue with the Select  Committee which is going to pick the Members. As my colleagues \\nhave discussed, we need to get serious about EALA.  There are many issues which need to be \\nventilated in that Assembly yet we seem to take it for granted.  That is why we have not made \\nany serious progress on the question of having one united East Africa, or having one leadership.  \\nThe people in that Assembly may not be taking up serious matters. We have many issues to \\nlook at, for example, cross-border clashes and the East African market.  If we could trade freely \\nwithin East Africa, we would make serious progress.   \\n\\nIn  my  opinion,  if  you  look  at  the  composition  of  this  House,  we  have  fairly  young \\npeople.  When you look at the Senate, we also have middle aged people. My thought is that we \\nshould  send  the  older  generation  to  EALA,  especially  people  who  have  contested  for \\npresidency, so that they can go and debate heavy matters that touch on East Africa.  People like \\nWajackoyah should be sent there.  I am expecting to see the likes of Wajackoyah, Hon. Kalonzo \\nMusyoka, Hon. Raila Odinga and Hon. Gideon  Moi  in  that list.   Instead of leaving them to \\nroam around the country and disrupting our leadership, why can we not send them to EALA, \\nso that they can debate on serious matters affecting the East African countries? My suggestion \\nto  the  parties  that  will  pick  the  individuals  is  that  they  should  consider  these  people.    The \\nOrange  Democratic  Movement  (ODM)  should  bring  to  us  Hon.  Raila  Odinga.  The  Wiper \\nDemocratic  Movement  should  bring  to  us  Hon.  Kalonzo  Musyoka  and  the  Kenya  African \\nNational Union (KANU) should bring to us Hon. Gideon Moi.  We from Kenya Kwanza, might \\nlook for His Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta if he wishes to be on the list.  \\n\\nAn Hon. Member: No! He is in Jubilee Party. \\nHon.  Johana  Kipyegon  (Emurua  Dikirr,  UDA):  So,  Jubilee  should  bring  us  Uhuru \\nKenyatta.  We do not want these great Statesmen roaming around the country and troubling \\nour  President.    They  should  be  in  EALA  debating  matters  that  affect  the  East  African \\nCommunity. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, that is my submission and I am looking forward to that day we will vet \\n\\nthose Members in this House. Thank you. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Member for Taveta. Where is he?  Did he login and leave? There you \\n\\nare. \\n\\nHon. John Bwire  (Taveta, WDM):  Thank  you,  Hon. Speaker for the opportunity to \\naddress you again.  I want to contribute to the Motion and agree with my colleagues who have \\nstated  earlier  that  we  need  competent  people  who  will  address  multilateral  and  bilateral \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  recommend candidates who come  from  border towns like Taveta  and \\nBusia to be considered in those positions. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Omboko, Milemba. \\nHon. Omboko Milemba (Emuhaya, ANC): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I was among \\nthe first people here. Thank you for the opportunity you have given me to contribute on this \\nmatter. \\n\\nLet me begin by congratulating and supporting the list of Members in that Committee.  \\nThe list is solid and, at least, I see two people with the Chief of the Order of the Burning Spear \\n(CBS) title.  I also see Hon. Muhia who has served in that Assembly before, who will also be \\none of the co-chairpersons.  \\n\\nThe East African Community is a very old institution.  The old Assembly left several \\nmarks  in  Kenya  including  parts  of  Upper  Hill  that  we  refer  to  as  Community.    The  new \\nAssembly  which  began  in  1999  and  was  actualised  in  2000  established  the  Legislative \\nAssembly under Article 9 of the Assembly’s Constitution.  This is an important institution for \\nour  regional  coordination,  especially  on  matters  culture,  trade,  economy,  and  politics. \\nTherefore, I am looking forward to this Committee vetting and bringing us names that really \\nqualify to sit in the Assembly. \\nThe other thing that Members have mentioned here is the fact that we need qualified \\n \\nand esteemed people to represent us in EALA.  The Member for Emurua Dikirr, who has just \\nspoken before me, sought to find highly qualified people. He was just yearning to find high \\nquality people who can command certain respect within the East African Community so that \\nthey can be felt heavily when they walk, speak, refer to matters about Kenya and represent us. \\nHe may not have necessarily just been speaking about the old guards who were in the elections \\nrecently. What is the stature of the man we are taking to the East African Legislative Assembly, \\nso that when he walks around, he is an ambassador of some sort who is actually representing \\nthe  Kenyan  interests?  By  his  looks,  exposure,  and  experience,  he  is  just  enough  to  make \\nrepresentation better. Therefore, I ask this Committee to do its work very well. When it comes \\nto the elections, we will vet these people and take very high quality people to the Assembly.  \\nThe East African Community, and EALA in particular, is so important because there \\n \\nare many matters that affect us. Let me deal with the positive ones because whenever we talk \\nabout this Assembly, we tend to deal with conflicts. We need trade between Kenya and Uganda. \\nUganda has been one of our leading trader partners until Britain took over. We need Tanzania \\nbecause of the plenty of cereals there. We need other products from Congo that is now part of \\nthe expanded EALA.  \\n \\nI believe the people who will be elected to this Assembly will be people who can tap \\ngood relations that can improve the movement of goods between the borders, so that we can \\nbenefit from the trade between the East African bloc. We should create an Assembly that will \\nmake  laws  that  will  move  us  towards  even  a  closer  cooperation.  I  heard  about  a  common \\ncurrency. I heard of the issue of removing tariff barriers of trade, particularly between Kenya \\nand Tanzania, where we have many grains. I hear there are 14 trade barriers, which need to be \\nremoved. This will make us have greater cooperation.  \\n \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon. Moses Wetangula) left the Chair] \\n\\n[The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Gladys Boss) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nWithout much ado, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I beg to support. Thank you very much.    \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Igembe Central, we have one more person.   \\nHon. Daniel Karitho (Igembe Central, JP): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I have really been looking \\nfor this chance to address the House. I am grateful that I got it. May I start by thanking God \\nand the people of Igembe Central for believing in me and trusting in my capacity to lead them \\nas their area Member of Parliament.  I  also  congratulate  you, Hon.  Deputy  Speaker, and the \\nSpeaker himself, for your election. I start by saying that I am grateful to the people of Igembe \\nCentral for believing in  me; the people of Wathiru Ward, Kiran’gondu Njia Ward, Kangeta \\nWard and Igembe East Ward, thank you very much. I will fight very hard to deliver on my \\npromises. I will not let you down.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I come from Igembe Central, a region known for producing what \\nwe internationally refer to as ‘green gold’. Locally, we call it mairungi, miraa and khat. As we \\ntalk, that industry has been employing more than 500,000 people. Today, as we deliberate on \\nthe team that will be handling our cases at EALA, we should have a team that will represent \\nKenya and represent Kenya’s interests politically, socially, and even economically.  \\nI know Tanzania very well. They have a lot of miraa around Tanga, in Mumbu, and \\n \\nhave not given us a chance to sell our miraa there. Therefore, I expect the team that will be \\npicked to be able to negotiate on behalf of farmers and traders in Meru, so that we can have a \\nchance to sell our ‘green gold’ there. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker,  Igembe Central  has not  been represented properly.  Electricity \\nconnectivity is about 30 per cent. Not a single kilometre of tarmac has been done for the last \\n10  years.  As  our  President  said  the  other  day,  we  are  giving  subsidy  to  production  and  not \\nconsumption. Right now, there is a strong famine. We expect to see the Government deliver \\nseeds  as  we  look  forward  to  receive  rains  in  October,  so  that  we  in  future,  do  not  go  back \\nlooking for famine relief food. We are receiving famine relief food which is bought at billions \\nof shillings. I believe the harvest would not be at that cost if that money was diverted to bring \\nin seeds. The harvest could not be worth that cost. It would be of great benefit to the people of \\nMeru and Igembe in particular.  \\n \\nWe  have  an  area  called  lower  Igembe  that  is  very  arable.  However,  flowing  water \\nthough rivers seem to have dried. Farmers cannot transport their farm produce to the market \\nbecause of poor road network. If that area is well connected to tarmac, I believe we can feed \\nthe whole of Meru County and Lower Eastern. As we talk of food security, we cannot have \\nfood security in areas where there is no human security. Therefore, if the areas that are prone \\nto insecurity are developed and we have enough police stations, like in Uthini, where there is \\na  fully  packed  police  station,  we  can  have  enough  food  for  ourselves  and  even  assist  other \\ncounties. \\n \\nWe  also  lack  electricity.  Our  education  standards  have  been  going  down  because \\nschools are not connected to electricity yet we are expected to compete against other Kenyans \\nwho have electricity in  their schools.  All  these factors  are bringing our education standards \\ndown. This monster called delocalisation has destroyed our education in Igembe because most \\nof  the  teachers  brought  to  handle  institutions  there  are  foreigners  who  do  not  know  the \\nsituations in the area hence education standards have been going down. We need people who \\ncan understand one another. Although the teachers are Kenyans, we need Kenyans from our \\nregions; Kenyans who know our problems and how to handle our  people. The schools were \\ndoing well before delocalisation. Even the giant schools that were doing wonderfully are now \\ngoing down. Something should be done and I believe it will be done.  \\n \\nteam that is able to negotiate, and represent us to our benefit. \\n\\nAs I wind up, I believe we are going to have a team that will represent us in EALA; a \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity. I thank God and you all.  \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. The last under this Motion will be the Member for \\n \\nManyatta. We still have a chance until 9.00 p.m. Hon. Members, everybody will have a chance \\nto make their maiden speech.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Gitonga. \\nHon. Gitonga Mukunji (Manyatta, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I take \\nthis chance to support the Committee. As many other Members have put it, we need Members \\nthat  understand  our  integrity  and  its  purpose.  The  East  African  Community  has  a  lot  of \\npotential.  We  need  to  strategise  on  how  to  scale  up  our  trade  and  have  common  industries. \\nCurrently, we are importing fertiliser and many other items.  It is possible that the EAC can \\nestablish a factory to manufacture that particular product that is used by all partner States.  \\n\\nWe need to elect Members to EALA in a wise manner. I cannot put my finger on any \\nparticular achievement of the last Assembly at EALA. I even googled to see their contributions, \\nbut there were none. We need to have ways of checking their performance and I am hoping \\nthis Assembly will come up with ideas of ensuring that we hold them accountable. We, unlike \\nthem at EALA, have sufficient checks and balances from our constituents in case we do not \\nperform to their expectations. \\n\\n If it is the President, he has the legislature and the other arms of Government to check \\non him. This is not the case when it comes to EALA. Their main duty is to ensure that they \\ndefend  the  interests  of  Kenya  in  the  Community.  Right  now,  we  have  a  trade  deficit  with \\nTanzania. We need to know how we can balance that. It is up to those Members to ensure that \\nwe achieve that. They must bring in agenda and legislation that is going to help Kenya achieve \\nthat.  \\n\\nWith that, I beg to support the Motion as given by the Leader of the Majority Party. I \\n\\nthank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.             \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Mover to reply.  \\nHon. Kimani Ichung’wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Let me \\ntake this opportunity to  thank all the Members who have contributed to  this  Motion. A few \\nissues have been mentioned and I just want to pick from where Hon. Wanjiku Muhia left. She \\nis Member emeritus of EALA. On the issue of continuity, I encourage the Committee to look \\nat the nomination rules and the timelines. When we vote as a House, that is something we need \\nto look into. We do not have to lose everything that happened in the previous Assembly because \\nwe are getting new Members into the Assembly.  \\n\\nI want  to  encourage,  as  my Deputy, Hon.  Owen  Baya, said,  and without seeming to \\ncampaign for anybody, that it is good to have some institutional memory. We had a number of \\nMembers in the previous Assembly who have now joined us. Hon. Mpuru Aburi, Hon. Wanjiku \\nMuhuia, and Hon. Jematiah are here with us. Hon Oburu Odinga is now in the Senate as the \\nSenator for Siaya. We also had Hon. Simon Mbugua, Hon. Abdikadir, Hon. Noor Mohamed, \\nHon. Fatuma Ibrahim and Hon. Kennedy Musyoka. Hon. Abdikadir and Hon. Simon Mbugua \\nhad resigned to run for parliamentary seats. Hon. Kennedy Musyoka, Hon. Noor Mohamed and \\nHon. Fatuma Ibrahim are still there.  When the time comes, if they are interested, we should be \\nable to consider them.  \\n\\nThere is something Hon. Johana Ng’eno mentioned and I do not know if he is still here. \\nIt is good that besides having institutional memory, we should have leaders who have served \\nthe nation. We need nationalists and Statesmen to serve in EALA. I also want to join him to \\nencourage,  especially  the  Orange  Democratic  Movement  and  WIPER-K  to  consider \\nnominating Hon. Kalonzo Musyoka.  \\n\\nI know the son was there, but consider nominating Hon. Kalonzo Musyoka to EALA. \\nThe former Prime Minister, the Right. Hon. Raila Odinga, should also be considered for EALA. \\nSuch  nomination  will  not  only  be  an  honour  to  a  leader  who  has  been  a  Prime  Minister  in \\nKenya, but also dissuade him from what I have seen him trying to do in the recent past, namely, \\nattending the Bunge La Mwananchi forum at Jevanjee Gardens. It is more honourable for Raila \\nOdinga to be attending the East Africa Legislative Assembly other than Bunge La Mwananchi. \\nI am not saying this in any way to belittle Bunge La Mwananchi. It is a good place to engage \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It is  an insult because it is him and His Excellency \\nUhuru Kenyatta who led those boda boda riders to the state of the economy where Kenya is in \\ntoday. \\n\\nI  want  to  encourage  our  brothers  and  sisters  in  ODM  and  their  leadership  to  please \\nconsider nominating Hon. Raila Odinga and Hon. Hon. Kalonzo Musyoka. Beyond EALA, it \\nis probably time, as a House, we started thinking of how to engage our national leaders who \\nlose in national elections. It is time we started thinking how to engage the caliber of leaders \\nlike Hon. Kalonzo Musyoka, His Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta, and Hon. Raila Odinga in our \\nnational  conversations  and  think  of  how  we  would  even  create  the  position  of  Leader  of \\nOpposition that would give them a forum other than seeing the stature of Hon. Raila Odinga \\nwith Hon. Babu Owino and T.J Kajwang in Jevanjee Gardens and the next day in Kariobangi. \\nI hear tomorrow or the following day they will be in Kibra inciting Kenyans.  \\n\\nHon.

Millie Odhiambo, \\nyou can shout from your seat, but the issues I am raising are pertinent. I would encourage you, \\nHon. Millie Odhiambo, instead of shouting from your seat to engage with your leader in ODM \\nto know what legislative measures you would bring to this Assembly to deal with the question \\nof food prices in Kenya and the rising cost of living. Because it is not enough to incite Kenyans \\nout there. It is better to use your leadership positions to bring agendas before the House that \\nwill improve the lot. \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon Deputy Speaker, I know Hon.

It is the State capture \\nthat was perpetuated by  the  handshake brothers and the Government  that has destroyed our \\neconomy  and  country.  You  pretend  now  that  you  will  go  and  incite  Kenyans  in  Jeevanjee \\nGardens, Kariobangi and Mathare. Kenyans are more intelligent than you think.

There are even other Members who were re-\\nelected, but they have not had an opportunity to speak.

Deputy Speaker, I beg to move the \\n\\n \\nfollowing Motion: \\n\\nThat, pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 33 and notwithstanding the \\nprovisions of Standing  Order 97(1) on  Limitation of Debate on Motions, this  House \\nresolves to extend its Sitting time today, Thursday, 13th October 2022 until 9.00 p.m. \\nThe gist of this Motion is to allow many Members to contribute, as we move to the next \\nMotion which is Order No.9 by Hon. Elsie Muhanda. All our new Members and those who \\nhave not spoken will have an opportunity to contribute before we go on recess. It will be very \\nunfair for a new Member or a Member who has been re-elected to go back home during the \\nrecess without getting the chance to stand in the House where people elected you to come, and \\nat least, thank them on national television. If the House agrees to extend the Sitting today up to \\n9p.m., it will be a good opportunity. If Members manage time and we finish before that time, \\nit will not matter. At least, nobody will be locked out because we have about two and a half \\nhours. If Members contribute for 10 minutes, you can count the number of Members who will \\nspeak. There are very many Members who have not spoken. \\n\\nTherefore, I just wanted to move that Motion and request the House to agree with me \\nto extend the Sitting up to 9.00 p.m. Everybody will have opportunity to speak. As we take our \\nshort recess, you will not be blamed that you came to the House, but you did not speak.

It \\nis on feeding our school children, especially during this drought season. It is a good Motion for \\neverybody to say something. \\n\\nWith those remarks, I want to ask Hon. Kaguchia to second. \\nHon. Kaguchia John (Mukurweini, UDA): Hon. Deputy Speaker, first, I would like to \\ntake  this  opportunity  to  second  the  Motion  which  has  been  proposed  by  the  Leader  of  the \\nMajority Party. It is very important for every new Member and even those who have come back \\nto be given an opportunity to give their maiden speech. \\n\\nI would like to take this opportunity as well to congratulate you and our Speaker for \\nbeing elected in the last elections that we had in this National Assembly for the speakership. I \\nalso  thank  the  people  of  Mukurweini  for  electing  me  as  their  Member  of  Parliament,  and \\nbestowing on me the mandate to take care of their issues in the next five years. As I say this, I \\nunderstand very well that this is just an opportunity that I have been given, not because I was \\nthe  best  in  Mukurweini,  but  because  the  people  of  Mukurweini  saw  it  fit  to  believe  in  the \\npromises and hope that we gave them. I promise that I will be very keen to ensure that we fulfill \\nwhat we promised them as much as possible.  \\n\\nI  also  want  to  thank my  family who stood with  me during this time.  I would  like to \\nrecognise the late Richard Kaguchia, my father, who unfortunately passed on about 10 months \\nbefore I was elected as a Member of Parliament. He would have been very happy to see me \\nhere. I would like to promise the people of Mukurweini that I am going to represent them and \\nI am going to be their voice. I am going to be fearless and will stand by what they want us to \\ndo. I am particularly keen on developing the infrastructure of Mukurweini, especially the road \\nnetwork.  Whereas  Nyeri  County  has  modestly  received  some  good  infrastructural  projects \\nparticularly  roads,  Mukurweini  Constituency  has  lagged  behind.  It  has  not  benefited  from \\ntarmac  roads for the last 20  years. What  we have had is  a very  small  contribution  from  the \\nnational kitty to the road network. I am promising the people of Mukurweini that as we work \\ntogether with the Kenya Kwanza Government, we shall be addressing the issue of roads that \\nwere proposed and passed. I was very much involved in lobbying, unfortunately, they were not \\ndone  because  there  were  no  funds.  We  are  in  touch  with  departments  that  are  involved, \\nincluding  the  National  Treasury  to  ensure  that  enough  money  is  provided  for  in  the \\nConstituency.  \\n\\nI  am  very  keen  on  ensuring  that  the  road  that  goes  through  Gikondi  all  the  way  to \\nKabuta is completed. I will ensure that the road that goes from Ichamara all the way to Rutune \\nand all the way to Gakonya is done. The road that goes from Maseno to Ndhia-Kamolo will \\nalso be done. We will work with the Government departments that are in charge of roads so \\nthat the road that goes from  Mikiraniru all the way to  Gumba-Tuguyoini is  done. I am  also \\nkeen to ensure that the Gaikundo-Kanunga-Kaheti Road all the way to Gatiki is also done. I \\nwill  be  pushing  for  these  infrastructural  projects.    I  will  also  be  very  keen  on  Karindi-\\nWahunduru  and  Karindi-Rurii  Road.  This  will  take  our  Constituency  to  a  level  that  other \\nconstituencies are enjoying. \\n\\nI am keen on the issue of irrigation in my constituency. We will be pushing for major \\nprojects in irrigation particularly on the larger Kiganjo area which serves Mukurweini West. \\nWe are going to push the Nyawamu Irrigation Scheme that serves Gikondi. We will ensure that \\nwe  complete  the  Hamaiko  Irrigation  Project  that  has  already  started.  I  will  also  push  the \\nMungagaga Water Irrigation Project to have most parts of Mukurweini covered.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I am encouraging our Government to show concern on the plight \\nof young people in this country.  Mukurweini has had very many hardworking young people \\nwho have not benefitted from post-secondary school education. I know this is an area that we \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We will have a project called akili ni mali, where we are going to empower \\nyoung people to gain education and employment skills that will make them employable and be \\nable  to  employ.  We  will  make  use  of  technical  institutions  like  Mukurweini  Technical \\nInstitution and others to promote our young people and ensure they get away from shopping \\ncentres and the illicit brew which is a great concern in the Mount Kenya Region.  \\n\\nI call upon our Government to declare illicit brew a national disaster. It is ravaging our \\nyouth  and  making  them  useless  in  our  community.  In  future,  I  will  bring  a  Motion  in  this \\nAssembly to have it declared a national disaster. I will propose that we fight manufacturing, \\nproduction and distribution of illicit brew which has become a menace in this country.  It has \\nmade our young people unproductive. It has also made them zombies in some areas. They are \\nnot able to think on their own without consuming drugs. \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  will  also  be  very  keen  working  together  with  the  Rural \\nElectrification  and  Renewable  Energy  Corporation  (REREC)  and  the  Kenya  Power  and \\nLightning  Company  (KPLC)  to  ensure  that  Mukurweini  benefits  fully  from  the  Last  Mile \\nProgramme. We have very many people in Mukurweini who do not  enjoy electricity at this \\ntime and age. Mukurwein is probably the second worst connected constituency in Nyeri County \\nafter one of the neighbouring sub-  counties in  the upper side of Nyeri.  We will be working \\ntogether in ensuring that every home gets and enjoys electricity connectivity.  I know that if \\nwe support our people fully, since they are very hard working, they will be keen to use their \\nGod-given capacity and work hard to produce. This will benefit and empower them.  \\n\\nI know for sure the people of Mukurweini produce so much milk in this country. We \\nhave contributed largely to the growth and development of the economy through dairy farming. \\nWe have sweet potatoes and arrow roots. If they are properly supported and given the capacity, \\nthey will produce more and contribute to the economic growth of our country. \\n\\nAs a country, we have to tap into the potential of our young people. I am looking at \\nyoung people across the country because we are not making proper use of their capacity. We \\nare not engaging them fully to get them to the level and potential that will contribute to our \\neconomic growth.  \\n\\nI  beg  to  second  this  Motion  and  hope  that  all  my  colleagues  are  going  to  get  an \\n\\nopportunity to make their contributions today. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\n \\n\\n(Question put and agreed to) \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, this is a kind request. As we move to the next \\nOrder, I politely ask, as a good gesture to the Members who are new in the House and are here \\nfor the first time and need to make their maiden speeches, to be given priority. Their electorate \\nand  constituents  are  waiting  to  hear  from  them.  If  the  senior  Members  could,  at  least,  cede \\nspace for them, it will be a collegial thing to do in the House. I am persuading, including my \\nvery good friend, Sir. George, to cede space if he can. It is entirely up to you. I also see that I \\nhave Members who had already spoken just shortly and their cards are still in place. Kindly, \\ncede it to give other people an opportunity. We can get all the new Members to speak today \\nplus more. Like the Member for Mbeere North, you just spoke, but I can see you are still on \\nthe list with your card.  \\n\\nThank you. \\n \\n\\nMOTION \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker: Sorry, Hon. Elsie Muhanda. \\nHon. Elsie Muhanda (Kakamega County, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nI want to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment as the Deputy Speaker \\nand specifically, coming from the women caucus. Indeed, we are overjoyed.   \\n\\nI want to thank the people of Kakamega for electing me tano tena overwhelmingly.  I \\nmake a special dedication of this Motion to the child in Kakamega and Kenya as a whole, who \\ndid not get a meal today. I beg to move the following Motion: \\n\\nThat, aware that school meals are an important safety net for vulnerable children \\nfrom  food  insecure  households  and  communities  in  Kenya;  appreciating  that  school \\nmeals  have  multiple  benefits  such  as  increased  school  enrollments  and  attendants; \\nsignificant  and  positive  contribution  to  reducing  hunger  and  improving  nutritional \\nintakes; noting that primary school completion rates have been found to be higher in \\nschools that provide meals; thus school meals remain a core development intervention \\nto support the country’s achievements in the education sector.   \\n\\nRecognising  that  some  county  governments  have  adopted  direct  and \\ncommunity-led  initiatives  for  Early  Childhood  Development  and  Education  (ECDE) \\nschool feeding programs; concerned that the exercise is not supported by a clear policy \\nand budgetary framework and it does not support children in primary and secondary \\nschools  who  form  the  basic  education  ecosystem;    cognizant  of  the  fact  that  where \\nschool  meal  programs  have  been  initiated,  it  has  been  noted  that  they  encounter \\ndifferent challenges that impede their effectiveness. This includes insufficient resources \\ndue  to  low  budgetary  allocation  and  budget  cuts;  lack  of  a  school  feeding  policy; \\ninadequate safe cooking and drinking water; drought and famine; poor food storage; a \\nlengthy procurement process; insecurity and dilapidated infrastructure among others. \\n\\nThis  House,  therefore,  resolves,  that  the  Ministry  of  Education,  through  the \\nrelevant State department, immediately develops a school feeding policy to cover basic \\neducation pupils, and sustain the program in order to ensure that children are maintained \\nin schools for effective learning and improve their wellbeing. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, let me begin by defining school feeding as the provision of food, \\nmeals, snacks or take-home incentives conditional upon school attendance to children, and their \\nhouseholds through school-based programs.  The meals are either prepared at schools, in the \\ncommunity or delivered from centralised kitchens. Article 53(c) of the Constitution of Kenya \\nstates that every child has a right to basic nutrition, shelter and health care.  Referring to the \\npoverty Index of 2022, 17 per cent of Kenyan population live below Kshs200 per day. This \\nmeans that 8.9 million Kenyans live in extreme poverty.   \\n\\nKenya is ranked No.86 out of 117 qualifying countries in the 2019 Global Hunger Index \\nthus classifying the countries situation as serious, and hence shows the level of real dire need.   \\nThe  World  Food  Programme (WFP)  has  shown  that  most  people  who  are  most \\nvulnerable  to  food  security  live  in  the  dry  areas  which  covers  80  per  cent  of  the  country. \\nChildren are the demographic group that is most vulnerable to hunger because their growing \\nbodies are more vulnerable. About 29 per cent of the children in rural areas and 20 per cent of \\nthose living in towns have stunted growth.   \\n\\n The  Coronavirus  disease  of  2019  did  not  make things  easy.  We  have  had  efforts  to \\nhave  feeding  programs  in  Kenya  since  1980s.  We  had  the  Maziwa  ya  Nyayo  and  Non-\\nGovernmental Organizations (NGOs) such as the Food for Education who partnered with some \\nMembers of Parliament like the Member for Dagoretti South. Because of the grave situation, \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Members who have started feeding programs in their areas like Hon. Christopher \\nAseka and Hon. Milemba. We thank them, but it is not easy given the budgetary constraints.   \\nWe equally have the Ministry of Education which has some feeding programs in ASAL \\nareas and slums. This is not enough because the whole of Kenya needs the feeding program.  \\nUsed primarily to  incentivise enrolment  and retention  of rural  children and girls,  subsidised \\nmeal programs have played an integral part in realising the country’s goals of universal primary \\neducation.   \\n\\nHistorically, the involvement of NGOs has greatly limited the Kenyan Government’s \\nrole  in  the  direction  of  stewardship  of  these  programs.    Reliance  on  donor  support  and \\nmanagement has subjected the programs to fluctuating and often, conditional support from the \\nactors.    Financial  strains  and  infrastructural  challenges  have  been  the  major  setback  in  the \\nGovernment’s ability to successfully fund and operate its own feeding program.  Noting the \\neffects  of  the  recent  COVID-19  Pandemic,  it  has  really  affected  the  primary  attendance  of \\nschools.    You  find  that  most  children  have  not  been  guaranteed  completion  of  their  school \\nlearning. The risks for children during this pandemic have included families falling into deeper \\npoverty,  threats  to  survival,  health  and  child  safety  and  extravagation  of  the  learning  crisis. \\nWide  spread  unemployment,  income  loss  and  budget  constraints  have  severely,  affected \\nhousehold financial ability to keep students in schools. As for the poorest households, budget \\nconstraints have caused them to keep their children out of school.  Since schools re-opened, \\nchildren have not reported to school in many parts of Kakamega County.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  for  the  sake  of  that  poor  child  in  Kenya  who  fainted  during \\nparade  because  of  hunger;  for  the  sake  of  the  poor  parents;  for  the  sake  of  us  having  high \\nretention; for the sake of the child who fell prey to goodies along the road because of lack of \\nfood and eventually got pregnant; for the sake of children in the drought areas; and for the sake \\nof  malnourished  children,  the  school  feeding  program  must  work.  As  I  conclude,  this  is \\nimportant in order for the Government to ensure a 100 per cent transition from pre-primary to \\nprimary, to secondary enrolment and also improve attendance. School meals are an important \\nsafety net strategy for the disadvantaged vulnerable majority of school going children facing \\nsecurity challenges in Kenyan households and communities.  \\n\\nTherefore,  I  wish  to  request  the  Members  to  support  me  and  resolve  that  the \\nGovernment, through the Ministry of Education and the relevant State departments, to develop \\na school feeding policy. This will ensure a coordinated approach to provision of school meals \\nfor  learners  at  all  basic  levels  of  education  and  propose  budgetary  allocation  to  sustain  this \\nprogram, so as to ensure that children are maintained in schools for effective learning.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I beg to move and request Hon. Omboko Milemba to second this \\n\\nMotion. Thank you. \\nHon. Omboko Milemba (Emuhaya, ANC): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Let me \\n \\ncongratulate  Hon.  Elsie  of  Kakamega  County  for  moving  this  Motion  on  school  feeding \\nprogram. I will be very brief. The earliest signs of trying to introduce school feeding program \\nin Kenya can be traced as early as 1941. The colonial government tried what they called first \\nnational schools meals policy. Mainly, this was to give proteins to students because the children \\nwere being fed a lot of carbohydrates.  \\n\\nThe second most pronounced one would be what the Mover mentioned as the Nyayo \\nmilk’ or ‘maziwa ya Nyayo’ which lasted for a period of about 10 years from 1980’s to 1990’s. \\nLet me put it into perspective that later on, this Parliament tried to introduce ‘maziwa ya Nyayo’ \\nthrough a Bill introduced by a nominated Member, Hon. Beatrice Kwamboka, for those who \\nwill remember. However, it did not go through because when they looked at the costing, they \\nthought it was too expensive for those who were in the 11th Parliament.  \\n\\nThe  cost  was  approximated  to  be  Kshs1  billion  per  week  and  when  Parliament \\ncalculated it, they thought it was not really possible to have the programme running. The truth \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Currently,  the  Ministry, \\ntogether with other partners, is able to provide food in 10 counties. This is to all students mainly \\nin the ASAL areas like Makueni and other regions which most Members are aware of. They \\nare  providing  food  all  the  way  from  Grade  One  to  Class  Eight.  They  also  provide  fortified \\nporridge  to  young  children  in  those  areas.  There  has  also  been  an  attempt  by  the  Kenyan \\nGovernment to provide the same programme in informal sectors. Just to mention, in Nairobi, \\nwe have Mathare and Kibera. I can even widen and mention Kisumu where Obunga is receiving \\npart of these foods. In Kakamega, we have the Malemba area.  \\n\\nAs you know, I have a background in education. The Kenyan Government is trying to \\ndo something to provide meals in schools. What is the cost? Currently, the Government is using \\na budget of Kshs1.8 billion to do what I have just talked about. This shows very clearly that it \\nis  possible  to  achieve  this  if  this  House  pronounces  itself  on  this  matter  and  forces  that  the \\nGovernment provides a budget for school feeding. What would be the advantages of school \\nfeeding? I will take you to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which envisaged that \\nby  the  year  2015,  every  learner  in  primary  and  basic  education  will  be  able  to  finish  their \\neducation, whether a girl or a boy. Currently, most of the girls drop out because they have to \\nbe  engaged  in  domestic  chores  in  food  production.  The  boys  are  also  engaged  in  issues  of \\nlivestock keeping.  \\n\\nTherefore, if this good Motion is pronounced by this Parliament, we shall safeguard all \\nthe students in schools. So, we will retain them in school and they will transit 100 per cent. All \\nthe students who go to primary school must transit to secondary school. More so, remember in \\nthe Education Act, basic education is not only free, but is supposed to be compulsory. So, this \\nis a program that will ensure students are in school.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I have had my own experience with the school feeding program. \\nI must acknowledge Hon. Aseka who tutored me into these things. In my own constituency, \\nwe  use  partners  and  other  sources  to  provide  lunch  for  students  in  schools,  especially  the \\ncandidates. It is working for me and is popular. I want to tell this House that it has increased \\ntransition and also attendance.  \\n\\nFor instance, in 2017, the candidates in Class Eight were only about 2,000. The number \\nof candidates last year rose to 3,400 because of the school feeding program. Therefore, I want \\nto urge this House to support this Motion and the Government to create a budget for the feeding \\nprogram in our schools.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, because I want many Members to contribute to this Motion, I \\nwill not go on. This is a matter that is with us in our constituencies. You can feel it because \\nyou see hungry students going back to school after taking plain water only.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I beg to second. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, I will propose the Question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members,  I see there are many Members who want  to \\ncontribute.  I  now  call  upon  Member  for  West  Pokot  County.  The  Member  for  West  Pokot \\nCounty is not here. I now call upon the Member for Matungulu. \\nHon.

I want to congratulate you on being elected as Deputy Speaker of this \\nHouse.  \\n\\nI want to thank my sister Hon. Elsie for moving this Motion to deal with school feeding \\nprogramme in Kenya. I want to thank all Members for the support they gave us when we were \\nworking on entrenching Constituency Development Fund (CDF) in the Constitution. I want to \\nreport to you that we have worked tirelessly with Hon. Gichimu and made sure that the entire \\nlegislation,  workings  of  the  budgets  and  the  figures  that  need  to  be  entrenched  in  the \\nConstitution are done. The work is now beyond our hands. We have submitted it to the Table \\nOffice  and  it  has  been  forwarded  to  the  Speaker.  By  the  time  we  come  back  from  recess,  I \\nbelieve we will start the journey to amend the Constitution to entrench CDF. We are keen on \\nthis  because  Members  of  Parliament  are  very  key  to  this  Motion  on  feeding  programme.  I \\nbelieve that if we increase the allocations to CDF, National Government Affirmative Action \\nFund  (NGAAF)  and  have  Oversight  Authority  and  Stimulus  Economic  Fund  in  the \\nConstitution, Members of Parliament will be in  a position to  feed our children in  the  entire \\ncountry.  I  believe  this  House  has  the  power  to  make  laws  and  give  direction.  What  Hon. \\nGichimu and I have started will sort out the issue of inadequate budget which has been talked \\nabout  by  Hon.  Milemba  Omboko.  We  will  do  this  through  the  National  Government \\nConstituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF). \\n\\nWhen we begin this journey, I would like to urge Members to be vigilant and know our \\nenemy. You need to understand that the same enemy we had in 2015 when NG-CDF was in \\nplace is in court again to make it unconstitutional. If we want to have such Motions to proceed \\nand have enough funding, we must think outside the box, walk the talk and rise above the bar. \\nThat is why Hon. Gichimu and I have taken a bold step to amend the Constitution to entrench \\nthese  funds  in  the  Constitution  and  delink  them  from  any  interference  from  the  courts.  If \\nMembers  agree  to  our  proposed  amendment  to  entrench  NG-CDF,  NGAAF  and  the \\nempowerment fund in the Constitution, we will not be bothered to ask the government to deal \\nwith  school  feeding  programme.  It  will  be  one  of  your  priorities  as  national  leaders  in  this \\nHouse to budget for a feeding programme in your constituency. Let us look at this job seriously. \\nI am very sure that if we increase CDF from 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent, each Member will have \\nan opportunity to feed Kenyan children without crying to  the  government  for subsidies and \\nextra food for schools.  \\n\\nI thank Hon. Elsie. This is a Motion that Members of this House will approve. Once we \\ncome back from recess, we will start the journey to amend the Constitution for the benefit of \\nKenyans  who  elected  you.  I  believe  that  once  we  entrench  CDF,  NGAAF  and  have  an \\nEconomic Stimulus Fund in the Constitution, we will be in a position to appropriate money \\naccordingly without begging anybody. It is very clear. \\n \\n\\n(Hon. Kassait Kamket spoke off the record) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Kamket, we are not dealing with cows here. We are talking of serious matters of \\nfeeding students in this country. What is out of order? I have served for two terms in this House. \\nTo new Members, serving the people will be very difficult if you do not have CDF. It will be \\nvery difficult when you will not be able to give students bursaries in January and feed them \\nwithout funds come next year. We are the people who appropriate funds in this House. We are \\nthe people who allocate funds to other government departments. I do not see why we cannot \\nallocate funds to NGAAF to feed Kenyan children. We must rise above the board. When we \\nstarted this journey, we were required to get only 50 signatures. I want to thank you Members \\nfor  appending  your  signatures.  Even  Hon.  Kamket  signed  on.  There  are  335  Members  in \\nsupport of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker: The Member for Tiaty, you are out of order. You will not catch \\nthe Speaker’s eye by shouting out loud from the corner of a Chamber after just walking in. Let \\nthe Hon. Mule finish his submission. \\n\\nHon.  Stephen  Mule  (Matungulu,  WDM):  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  it  is  good  to  tame \\nsome of these people. We are talking of children in primary and secondary schools. Parents \\ncannot afford school fees and three meals a day. This is a Motion that every Member should \\nsupport as we go on recess. When we come back, we should work as a team to provide funds \\nand become oversight managers. In the outside world, you are seen as the CDF managers. I \\nwant to tell Kenyans that Hon. Mule, Hon. Rasso and Hon. Gichimu do not sign for any CDF \\npenny. We only offer oversight. There is a constituency committee that does that. What other \\ndevolved government do we need in this country if not for NGAAF? \\n\\nI  want  to  urge  the  Judiciary  not  to  listen  to  everyone  who  walks  to  the  courts  with \\npropaganda or hearsay. They have no clue how much Members of Parliament have assisted \\nstudents from Form One to university without paying school fees. There is no other way we \\nare  going  to  alleviate  poverty  in  this  country  without  funds  at  the  grassroots.  The  county \\ngovernments are performing their duties but during weekends, Kenyans seek  your help as a \\nMember of Parliament so that their children can go to school. On this Motion, Kenyans are \\nlooking up to you to make sure that every primary and secondary school has enough money to \\nfeed students. If we allocate money to the school feeding programme, we will tell principals \\nand head teachers to ensure that students are in school until we get enough money to pay school \\nfees. They should not send students back to their parents every weekend for lack of school fees. \\nLet us walk together as Members and entrench CDF and NGAAF in the Constitution and make \\nsure that a provision to feed Kenyan children is included in the next legislation. I urge school \\nprincipals to maintain students in school so that they can learn and prepare for exams before \\nDecember. Once we sort out this NGAAF menace, we will send cheques to schools and make \\nsure that you get enough money to pay school debts and to maintain students in school come \\nJanuary. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Mule, there are many new Members who have not made \\ntheir  maiden  speeches.  Let  us  give  them  an  opportunity.  Hon.  Member,  let  us  give  an \\nopportunity to the rest. Many new Members have not made their maiden speeches. I now call \\nupon the Member for Matayos Constituency. He will be followed by the Member for Samburu \\nCounty. We will then give a second chance to the Member for West Pokot who was not there \\nwhen I called her earlier.  \\n\\nThank you.  \\nHon.  Geoffrey  Odanga  (Matayos,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  for \\n\\n \\ngiving me this opportunity. \\n\\nI thank the people of Matayos Constituency in Busia County for giving me a third term \\nto  serve  them  as  their  Member  of  Parliament.  That  goes  a  long  way  to  demonstrate  the \\nconfidence they have in  me and  I assure them that  I will give them my best  so that we can \\ndevelop on what we started with them. I want to be in the rankings of Hon. Duale, Hon. Millie \\nOdhiambo, Hon. Moroto, and many others who have served five terms and beyond. \\n\\nI also  congratulate  you on your election as our Deputy Speaker. However, I want to \\nregister  my  disappointment,  that  I  came  to  this  House  a  few  minutes  after  1.00  pm.  I  was \\nnumber 10 on that queue. I have seen Members who have come after me, including one who \\ncame and I assisted him to slot in his card, given a chance to speak and go, despite my appeal \\nto the substantive Speaker to give me an opportunity.  \\n\\nI am from the ward. I have been in the hospital for about two weeks. I was operated \\nupon on my neck. This is the first time I am appearing here without a neck collar. I thought I \\nshould have been given a chance to speak on these important Motions, including the one that \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I wanted to comment on it \\neven after it had been done with. \\n\\nI realised that in as much as the Joint Committee has Members of ability to serve or to \\nelect our Members to the EALA, it is regionally and religiously imbalanced. It is against the \\ntenets  of  the  Constitution.  Having  said  that,  this  Motion  moved  by  Hon.  Elsie  who  is  the \\nMember for Kakamega is very worthy being before this House. She is talking about developing \\na policy. I want Members to mark the word ‘policy’. I know all of us agree that we should have \\nschool feeding programmes. The Motion is talking about the Government developing a policy \\non the school feeding programme. \\n\\nWe have had various programmes that have been developed very haphazardly in the \\ncountry.  Some  have  been  developed  by  the  county  governments,  while  others  have  been \\ndeveloped  by  the  national  Government.  The  aim  is  providing  food  to  some  institutions,  but \\nthere is no policy. We would have no problem in attracting access of our children to schools, \\nif a policy was in place. We would have no problem in maintaining them in school throughout. \\nWe need a policy for this. Just  as Mheshimiwa Omboko Milemba has said about the Nyayo \\nmilk that came in the late 70s - around 1979 - some of us enjoyed it. It went on up to, perhaps, \\nthe  middle  80s  to  the  90s.  Many  children  were  kept  in  school.  We  really  implore  that  as \\nMembers,  we  should  support  this  Motion  for  the  Government  to  develop  a  policy  that  will \\nmake sure our childrens’ well-being in nutrition and health are maintained. That is to ensure \\nthey are in school and are able to learn without problems.  \\n \\nthe queue.  \\n \\n\\nI want to insist that we want this Parliament to give fairness to Members who are on \\n\\n(An Hon. Member consulted with the Hon. Deputy Speaker) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon.  Geoffrey  Odanga  (Matayos,  ODM):  Can  I  have  the  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker \\nlistening? What is on your queue there should be reflected on our tablets here or on the walls, \\nso that I can know when I am number two and I should be given a chance to contribute after \\nthe first person. We also know that you enjoy discretion as per the Standing Orders. I do not \\nhave to sit here for three hours and a Member comes in, speaks and leaves. That is very unfair \\nto some of us Hon. Members. I also implore you that you do another induction. Members are \\nnot inducted enough. While seated here, I have seen two Members just cross from here. Can \\nyou please organise for an induction? I support Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you for the feedback, Member for Matayos. I now call \\nupon  the  Member  for  Mwatate,  Hon.  Peter  Shake.  I  do  not  know  if  I  have  pronounced  it \\ncorrectly. \\nHon. Peter Shake (Mwatate, JP): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for giving me the \\n \\nopportunity to make a Maiden Speech in this House. I have been in the queue for the last six \\ndays. I thank God for the opportunity that I have got today. My name is Hon. Peter Shake. By \\nthe grace of God, I am a born again Christian and, at the same time, a Canon in the Anglican \\nChurch.  \\n\\nFirst, I would like to thank the almighty God and the people of Mwatate for giving me \\nthis special opportunity to serve them as their fifth Member of Parliament. I do not take it for \\ngranted.  It  is,  indeed, a  great  honour  and privilege they have  given me.  My  great  people of \\nMwatate,  I  assure  you  that  I  will  serve  you  with  a  lot  of  commitment,  tirelessly  and  with \\ndedication. Special appreciation goes to my family and friends for offering total support before, \\nduring and after the elections.  \\nSecondly, I take this opportunity to congratulate you and the Speaker for being elected \\n \\nto serve in this 13th Parliament. I am not forgetting to congratulate my predecessor by the name \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Andrew Mwadime, who is now the Governor of Taita Taveta County. I congratulate him \\nfor his election. I wish him well in his new elective position.  \\n \\nMwatate  Constituency  has  its  own  uniqueness  and  challenges.  The  first  one  is \\nelectricity. Electricity connectivity has been a nightmare in Mwatate. We have only 30 per cent \\nconnectivity in Mwatate. This creates many issues in the employment of our youth. We have \\nTVETs there. The youth have trained and they have graduated. Some of them are welders and \\nthey have not been able to access electricity so that they can open Jua Kali workshops. I request \\nthe Government, through this honourable House, to add the grid of electricity in Mwatate so \\nthat we can help our youth and get them out of unemployment. \\n \\nSecondly, the roads are in a very poor state. I have been hearing from the last regime \\nthat 10,000 kilometres of roads have been constructed. I am not good in mathematics, but when \\nI try to divide the 10,000 by the 47 counties that we have. I found out that what we got in Taita \\nTaveta as a whole was only 40 kilometres of tarmacked road. I think our county has been short-\\nchanged. In terms of development, we found out that some counties are more developed. They \\nare getting more development than our county. I am requesting our new Government to allocate \\nTaita Taveta some money in the next budget for the construction of some more kilometres so \\nthat we can have access to our homes through those tarmacked roads. That is my request.  \\n\\nAnother challenge my constituency is facing is the problem of water. We have been \\nhaving  a  lot  of  problems  in  terms  of  getting  water.  In  fact,  it  is  very  scarce  in  Mwatate \\nConstituency. I am now requesting the Government, through this honourable House, if it can \\norganise so that we can tap water from Taveta.  We have got a lot of water from Taveta which \\nis our neighbouring constituency, almost 80 kilometres away. I urge the Government to tap the \\nwater to Mwatate to help our people there to get enough water for domestic use and irrigation.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Gladys Boss) left the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari) took the Chair] \\n\\nMwatate is a constituency which houses the headquarters of Taita Taveta County and \\nalso  a  business  hub  which  is  growing  very  fast.  The  economic  activities  in  Mwatate  are \\nbasically mining. Almost 70 per cent of Taita Taveta, Mwatate included, is composed of all \\ntypes of mines. Name any mineral, it is there. Our main economic activity is mostly mining. \\nOur youth in the mines are having problems because they do not have machinery to help them \\nexplore the minerals so that we can change the economy of Mwatate. Therefore, my request is \\nfor the current Government to make sure it provides the machinery so that the people can use \\nthem for mining purposes to uplift the economy of Mwatate. In fact, in the near future, I will \\nbring a Motion to declare mining in Taita Taveta an economic activity. When the Government \\nis supporting miraa, coffee and tea, the same should also be done to our small-scale miners so \\nthat we can tap the minerals to help our people develop.  \\n\\nLast but not least, let me speak on the Motion which is before us - the school feeding \\nprogramme.  Let  me  say  that  due  to  this  drought,  Mwatate  has  been  hit  hard  especially  the \\nschool children. Many of them had dropped out in the first term. But in second term, as the \\narea MP, by the grace of God, I managed to introduce a school feeding programme for the 68 \\nprimary schools and, up to now, they are food sufficient. However, that programme is not going \\nto  take long.  I think by the end of this term,  I  will not  be able to  support them again.  So,  I \\nsupport the Motion.  \\n\\nGod bless Kenya, God bless Mwatate. Thank you. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Ms.) Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member. \\n\\nThe next chance will go to the County Member of Parliament for Samburu County.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

(Ms.) Pauline Lenguris (Samburu CWR, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary \\nSpeaker, for giving me this opportunity. This is the first time I am speaking in this House and \\nI am so grateful. Secondly, let me thank the great people of Samburu for giving me this chance \\nto  represent  them  in  this  House.  I  am  grateful  to  them  for  electing  me  as  their  Woman \\nRepresentative.  I  started  this  journey  long  time  ago  -  15  years  down  the  line  -  and  I  am  so \\nhumbled for the trust they have bestowed upon me this time. I promise to serve them diligently, \\nwithout bias and with all the respect that they deserve.  \\n\\nThirdly,  let  me  thank  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Kenya,  His  Excellency  Dr. \\nWilliam Samoei Ruto  for the support he offered me during the campaign time. Let  me also \\ncongratulate him on being elected the President of this country. He is also my party leader and \\nI am so grateful for the support and the plans he has for this country. Because we know that we \\ninherited a country which the economy has really gone down, the people are suffering and I \\nunderstand from his agenda that he has good programmes that will put this country back to the \\nline  again.  Programmes  like  the  Hustler  Fund,  housing  and  universal  healthcare.  Those \\nprogrammes are going to support and help our people and hence, I believe that this honourable \\nHouse will give him the support that he requires to implement them. They will be able to uplift \\nthe lives of our people.  \\n\\nFourthly, I come from a region that is currently hardest hit by the drought. I think you \\nhave all seen on the televisions and also heard from the press statements that have been given \\nby Members from that region - northern Kenya. We are really faced by a very hard drought \\nand our people are really suffering because of hunger. We have lost many livestock and many \\nof our children are dropping out of school because the parents are not able to pay for the school \\nfees. The schools are also not able to feed the children. So, we are suffering both in the homes \\nand our children are suffering back in the schools. The country is facing a severe drought and \\nthe  threat  is  worsening  each  and  every  day.  The  household  food  security  has  really  been \\naffected and there has been minimal harvest in agro-pastoralist areas.  \\n\\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  water  has  also  become  a  major  challenge  for  both  human \\nbeings  and  livestock.  The  discharge  levels  have  gone  down.  Most  strategic  boreholes  have \\neither broken down or the discharge levels have gone down. Conflicts over pasture have also \\nerupted in most parts in Samburu County and, as the Member representing the County, I would \\nrequest  the  Government  to  spearhead  the  support  and  interventions  that  would  address  the \\nsuffering that people are undergoing in that County and region. We are talking of Samburu, \\nMarsabit,  Isiolo,  West  Pokot  and  parts  of  Turkana.  If  the  Government  is  not  going  to  do \\nsomething, we fear that lives are going to be lost.  \\n\\nThis week, I was in the county and we got reports of an old man who passed on due to \\nhunger.  So,  I  am  here  requesting  the  Government  to  fast-track  the  interventions.  Even  the \\ndevelopment partners who are working in this country; if there is any kind of support they can \\nbe able to give us, let them do so. We are requesting for any kind of support. Any other good \\nKenyan who is willing to support our people is highly welcome.  \\n\\nOn the school feeding programme, I support that it can be reinstated so that we can have \\nretention of our children back in school, especially now that the parents are not even able to \\npay their school fees.  \\n\\nThank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  for  giving  me  the  opportunity.  Maybe  I  can \\n\\ndonate some of the minutes to the Members who have not spoken.  \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Ms.) Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member. \\n\\nThe next chance will go to the Member for Wajir South, Hon. Mohammed Adow.  \\n\\nHon. Mohammed Adow (Wajir South, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker, \\nfor giving me this opportunity. I would like to thank the people of Wajir South for electing me \\nas their representative in this House. I also thank the hundreds of volunteers who helped me \\nthroughout  the  campaign  period,  showed  confidence  in  me  and  my  leadership  and  made  a \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  represent  Wajir  South,  which  is  the  second  largest \\nconstituency in this country; second only to North Horr in Marsabit. The size of Wajir South \\nis  about  23,000  square  kilometres.    To  give  a  snapshot,  that  is  the  size  of  Nairobi,  Central \\nKenya  and  Western  Kenya  combined.    It  is  represented  by  one  Member  of  Parliament.    I \\nbelieve, that is a blot on the conscience of Kenyans.  We have been short-changed many times \\nwhen  boundary  reviews  of  constituencies  have  been  carried  out.  We  hope  this  time  round, \\njustice, equity and even even-handedness will prevail.   \\n\\nWajir South has four sub-counties; with only two which are fully operational. The other \\ntwo are work in progress. The sheer size of the constituency makes it really difficult for delivery \\nof  services  not  just  from  the  Member  of  Parliament  and  other  elected  leaders,  but  also \\ngovernment and aid workers, who are in the process of alleviating the biting drought that is \\nafflicting my people at this time. \\n\\nDrought is a big problem right now for the people of Wajir South.  Over the years, we \\nhave seen cyclic droughts that have decimated livestock and made the people really weak. Over \\nthe past five years, we have had the lethal mix of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the locust invasion \\nas well as the drought. Last year, it was declared a national disaster. This year again, it is the \\nsame.  \\n\\nWe are here talking about drought and it is getting worse and worse by the day.  This \\nis the consequence of climate change, and it is here to stay with us. It is about time we learnt \\nto adapt and live with climate change.  It is a  global phenomenon and not much of our own \\nmaking.  But  we  are  bearing  the  brunt  of  the  ruthlessness  by  which  Western  industrialised \\ncountries have dealt with our environment. But we must adapt because if we do not, we will be \\nhaving  even  more  problems.    Right  now,  there  are  discussions  going  on  not  just  in  my \\nconstituency  and  the  greater  Wajir  County,  but  also  in  other  parts  of  the  country  that  are \\nafflicted by the dry spell.  Pastoralism, as we have seen over the ages, is untenable. We can no \\nlonger continue to chase rainfall because it has become less and far between.  What we need is \\nto adapt and change our lifestyles so that we get to live a much better life than the one we are \\nliving right now. That is because every year, we are seeing caravans of relief convoys taking \\nfood to the people. To an extent, we have been reduced to a people dependent on the goodwill \\nof  others.    We  are  talking  about  agro-pastoralism,  more  settled  farming  as  well  as  keeping \\nlivestock which is a priced source of livelihood for the people of the North, where Wajir South \\nis located.   \\n \\nWe can no longer continue as our forefathers to chase the rain, even if it meant crossing \\nthe borders because there is very little rain due to the phenomenon that we are facing.  We are \\ntalking about agriculture as an alternative mainstay for our people, so that they can grow their \\nown food and fodder for their livestock. That way, we would be able to keep on practising our \\npriced mainstay that is pastoralism and rearing of animals while, at the same time, growing our \\nown food.  This is where we are headed and we will be seeking as much help as possible in this \\ndirection.   \\n\\nAs we speak, there are throngs of aid workers criss-crossing Wajir County. The county \\ngovernment has re-jigged its budget and is offering relief aid to the people.  We are thankful to \\nthe county Governor and also to organisations like Save the Children, Kenya Red Cross, United \\nNations Childrens’ Fund and many others including World Vision, which are giving lifesaving \\naid and water to the people in my constituency.   \\n\\nThere are seven wards in my constituency and, out of those wards; three of them are \\nfacing water shortage. So, as we can see, my work is really cut out for me. I represent people \\nwho are facing all those problems that I have listed. \\n\\n Hon. Temporary Speaker, we have a fantastic Motion in front of us today.  It is one \\nthat deals with the provision of school meals to students. When I remember my childhood and \\ngrowing up in North Eastern Kenya, the school feeding programme made a big difference by \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

School  meals  really  contributed  to  many  of  us  remaining  in  school \\nbecause of the abject poverty most of the people there were living under and still do to this day.   \\n\\nI am in support of this Motion, but we have even a more pressing problem in North \\nEastern Kenya because of the action which the former Government took two years ago. With \\na stroke of a pen, 5,000 teachers were recalled from the region because of insecurity.  Today, \\nalmost  every  other  school  is  manned  by  one  teacher.    In  my  constituency  alone,  we  have  a \\nshortage of 300 school teachers.  Some of the schools in my constituency are manned by one \\nteacher and some of them  have been  closed. This is  quite unfair. We are bringing up a lost \\ngeneration which has been forced to go through the steps of schooling for those two years, but \\nhave learnt nothing.  We are appealing to the Teachers Service Commission (TSC), because I \\ndo not know what else to call it because this is marginalisation that is being brought through \\nthe back door, after we thought the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution had done away with \\nthat practise, which had been visited upon us by the previous regimes.  What we need is a return \\nof teachers back to the schools so that the young Kenyans living in that part of the country can \\nget education. \\n\\nWe have…. I thought I had ten minutes Hon. Temporary Speaker! \\nThe  Temporary  Speaker  (Hon.  (Ms.)  Martha  Wangari):  Yes,  and  they  are  almost \\n\\nover.  Just one minute or so \\n\\nHon. Mohammed Adow (Wajir South, ODM):  So, in summary, I would like to say \\nthat teachers need to go back to schools.  The funding for the school feeding programme will \\ngo a long way but again, for students who do not have teachers, it does not mean much. Thank \\nyou very much. \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Ms.) Martha Wangari):  Thank you Hon. Member. \\n\\nThe next chance goes to the Member for Embakasi West, Hon. Mark Mwenje. \\n\\nHon.  Mark  Mwenje  (Embakasi  West,  JP):  Finally!  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary \\n\\nSpeaker. Like most new Members would say, we have been waiting for quite a while.   \\n\\nBeing my Maiden Speech, let me start  by congratulating all the elected Members of \\nParliament. I also want to give a vote of thanks first to the Almighty God for giving me this \\nchance, to the people of Embakasi West who voted for me, to my family, my wife, my children, \\nmy sisters, my brother and all those who campaigned with me in Embakasi West. I want to \\nthank them for their support. It is obvious that my surname is quite common in Parliament. I \\nrecognise that my father served in this House. He made a name for himself while seated right \\nhere. Without him, I would not be here. To those Members who are in their third term including \\nyourself, at times, a good name is its own reward. I also recognise some of my late father’s \\nfriends who campaigned with me, the likes of Hon. Kamanda and Hon. Ndolo. There are so \\nmany people who supported me. I cannot mention all their names.     \\n\\nI thank the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance family in Nairobi, comprising of the \\nJubilee Party and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party. I also wish to thank the \\nfirst Member of Parliament for Embakasi West, George Theuri, for his service, for conceding \\nand for his candour.   \\n\\nI move on to Embakasi West, where during the campaigns, there were quite a number \\nof issues that we spoke about. I know I cannot speak to all of them. The people of Embakasi \\nWest require better infrastructure and roads. My constituency has some of the worst roads in \\nNairobi County. We get water once a week, or none at all. We have raw sewage spilling all \\nover.  \\n\\nWhen it comes to education, my constituency has 14 public schools versus a population \\nof 284,000 people. We have about 120 students in each classroom and that is even on the lower \\nside. One of my wards - Mowlem Ward - has only one primary school. Umoja One and Umoja \\nTwo wards share one secondary school. I come from a constituency where bursaries are issued \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Something has to \\nchange.  \\n\\nLand ownership is one of the biggest issues that we have in my constituency. People \\ndo not have title deeds. Mowlem Ward has a population of 89,000, where 70 per cent of the \\nWard is adjudicated land. So, 70 per cent of those people do not have title deeds. Whenever \\nyou hear of demolitions in Nairobi, this is the Ward that always has the highest number. That \\nhas to end.  \\n\\nWhen I talk about women and youth empowerment, it is straightforward. They need \\nfunds, training, jobs and opportunities. That is what the women and youths in my constituency \\nhave been lacking and that is what they sent me here for.  \\n\\nWith regard to  our sports infrastructure,  I come from a constituency which does not \\nhave any stadium or public grounds where some of the young men can engage in their sporting \\nactivities. This is quite unfair considering that quite a number of those facilities are in Nairobi. \\nBut my constituency lacks them. Those are some of the things, and many others, that I would \\nwant to look into. Hopefully, going forward, I will represent the people of Embakasi West.         \\n\\nEven if we are past that issue, I did not get a chance to contribute to the President’s \\nSpeech.  There  were  some  positives.  He  spoke  about  retaining  the  National  Government \\nConstituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF). As a Member of Parliament from Nairobi, I felt \\nthat the 25 per cent that is based on the number of wards punishes some of us. We have some \\nof  the  most  populous  constituencies  in  Nairobi.  That  25  per  cent  should  have  considered \\npopulation size rather than the number of wards. Going forward, that is something that I will \\nseek a review of and, hopefully, get more funds for some of the Nairobi constituencies, as I \\nwill explain a bit later on.   \\n\\nThe President spoke about education and health, which is good. But it is time that the \\nGovernment  gave us direction on the Competency  Based Curriculum  (CBC) and 8-4-4. We \\ncannot gamble with the lives of our children. Some of us who are young have children going \\nthrough this educational system. We need to be sure. We cannot be changing it after every 10 \\nyears. Whatever happens or comes out, it must be final and must last a generation.  \\n\\nHaving Cabinet Secretaries coming to the Floor of the House is a good idea, but they \\n\\nshould not come here to grandstand. Hopefully, they will be fair and respond to both sides.   \\n\\nThe Hustler Fund is a good idea, but I felt that the President’s Speech limited it. When \\nhe said that it will be issued through technology, that is not the promise that he made while he \\nwas  campaigning.  At  some  point,  he  had  said  that  he  would  make  it  quite  easy  and  have  it \\ndistributed by Members of Parliament. The Hustler Fund should be made accessible and quite \\neasy for people to apply.  \\n\\nI also wish to note that our country seems to be suffering from a campaign hangover. \\nWe even saw it here today. It is time that we accepted that somebody won. We competed and \\nelections  are  over.  We  cannot  keep  campaigning.  The  President  said  that  he  is  the  bigger \\nbrother  now.  My  colleagues  from  the  other  side  need  to  recognise  that  they  are  the  bigger \\nbrothers now. Let us not grandstand anymore. Let us allow our country to move forward.  \\n\\nYesterday,  the  President  was  in  Embakasi  Central,  and  he  visited  my  constituency. \\nSome of the things that I felt he should have mentioned in his Presidential Speech, he did so \\nwhile out there going round. Today, the Leader of the Majority Party accused the Leader of \\nOpposition,  Raila  Odinga  of  going  round.  The  President  is  doing  that.  He  spoke  of  quite \\nimportant issues. At times, it is during these public gatherings that we are able…Actually, that \\nis why all of us are here. Without those public gatherings, none of us would have been elected. \\nYesterday,  I  heard  the  President  speak  about  increasing  the  number  of  schools  in  Nairobi, \\nensuring that we have title deeds to sort out all the land matters in Nairobi within 12 months, \\nand opening the markets.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I hope that  the Governor of Nairobi will write to  Members of Parliament from \\nNairobi County and formally communicate that position to ensure that we feed our children, \\nespecially here in Nairobi. We thank him. This is something that many parents raised a number \\nof times during the campaigns. This is long overdue. Those of us who were in school in the \\n1990s remember maziwa ya Nyayo. So, it is nothing unheard of. I support the Motion. It is long \\noverdue.  \\n\\nAs I conclude, I reiterate that for those who won, especially the Government side, you \\nneed to bring the country together. The country is taking too long to heal. We cannot let the \\ncountry continue in the same way. We have a choice. We can follow the Kibaki route which \\nunited the country. Despite Moi opposing his candidature, we can go the route that Kibaki took \\nor take a new route, which is not the right one.  \\n\\nWith that, I thank you. I look forward to working with other Members.  \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Ms.) Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member. \\n\\nNow, we will go to the Member for Mbeere North, Geoffrey Ruku.    \\n\\nHon.  Geoffrey  Kariuki  Ruku  (Mbeere  North,  DP):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary \\nSpeaker. I want to contribute to the Motion on the school-feeding policy. Tomorrow, I will be \\nhaving a meeting with the headteachers of primary schools in Mbeere North Constituency. It \\nis true that Mbeere North is facing a very serious crisis as far as drought is concerned. I have \\nseen  it  circulating  in  the  news  media  that  some  children  have  resorted  to  eating  wild  fruits \\nbecause of the drought crisis. It is extremely shameful that almost 60 years after Independence, \\nwe are unable to feed ourselves as a nation. We are experiencing very humiliating situations \\nwhich should not be happening. As we come up with a school-feeding programme, it may be \\na short-term approach to take care of the food problem in this country. It is important to have \\nshort-term programs and, at the same time, mid-term and long-term programs of dealing with \\nthe drought crisis in this country.  \\n \\nOne  of  the  Members  has  mentioned  issues  to  do  with  climate  change,  which  is \\ncompounding all these issues into a serious crisis. It is important to put a framework which will \\nguide the monies that will be coming from climate financing to ensure that they are properly \\nused by Kenya to take care of such calamities.  \\n\\nThis  House  can  propose  and  enact  a  Bill  on  climate  financing  which  will  enable  a \\nnumber of dams to be constructed in the country. In my constituency, for instance, we have \\nKamumu Dam whose design is complete. The cost is about Kshs23 billion, but the Government \\nis not able to support it with the said amount. If the dam is completed, the people of Mbeere \\nNorth will have a sustainable water supply, and the issue of drought in Mbeere North will be a \\nthing of the past.  \\n\\nWe must come up with innovative ways. One, of them was proposed by the President \\nin this House. That, a water purchase agreement will be enacted and formed by the Government \\nof the day. At the same time, we need to earn ourselves all the funding or money that is coming \\nto the counties in form of climate financing so that it can implement huge projects which can \\nmitigate the effects of climate change. Those huge projects can be effective in every county of \\nthe Republic of Kenya, so that we can have mega dams which can serve all the corners of this \\ncountry to ensure that we have enough water to irrigate our farms. That way, lack of food in \\nour households and schools will be a thing of the past. \\n\\nHowever, in the short term, it is important we move with speed so that the Government \\nof the day can be able to feed the children in our schools. They are going hungry every single \\nday. Some of them are dropping out of school and the head teachers are facing a huge crisis \\nbecause they are not able to sustain the children in school.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

But you realise that we have many pupils being sent home \\nbecause  of  small  monies  which  parents  cannot  afford.  We  need  to  know  to  what  extent  the \\nprimary school education is free? Why are primary school pupils being sent home? We are told \\nthat the National Government Constituency Fund (NGCDF) cannot support parents who are \\nunable to pay Kshs200 or Kshs500 to ensure that they have a watchman and support staff in \\nprimary schools. Those monies are needed by the head teachers of those schools.  \\n\\nAs for the disbursement of money from the Ministry of Education to primary schools, \\nthe  amount  of  money  going  to  those  schools  per  term  is  ranging  between  Kshs30,000  and \\nbelow. A sum of Kshs30,000 cannot be able to sustain a primary school for a term. So, let the \\nGovernment be committed to what it says. If it is free primary education, let it be totally, free.  \\nIt is extremely bad and shameful to see poor pupils going home and yet, their parents \\ncannot even raise Kshs200. They stay at home for even a week and, at the same time; they are \\nnot able to feed them.  \\n\\nI beg to support this Motion as a short term way of taking care of the crisis which is \\ngoing on in this country. As a nation, we need to think in terms of the long-term and how we \\ncan have innovative ways of raising money which will ensure we avert the crisis of drought in \\nthis country once and for all.  \\n\\nI beg to support. Thank you. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you. The next chance will \\n\\ngo to the Member for Kitui South, Hon. Rachael Nyamai. \\n\\nHon. (Ms.) Rachael Nyamai (Kitui, South, JP)): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker, \\n\\nfor giving me a chance to contribute to this Motion. \\n\\nAt the outset, I support this Motion. I congratulate my friend, Hon. Elsie Muhanda for \\n\\ncoming up with such a good Motion at this moment in time.  \\n\\nBefore  I  continue,  I  congratulate  the  substantive  Speaker  and  his  Deputy  for  being \\nelected to preside over this august House. I would also like to congratulate you for accepting \\nto preside over this House this afternoon. It is a privilege from the Speaker. I would also like \\nto thank the Speaker for accepting our names, the six of us, to enable us to serve. I believe I \\ncan speak on behalf of my colleagues that we will do our best and we will be fair.  \\n\\nI take this opportunity to also thank the people of Kitui South for electing me for the \\nthird time  to  this  House.  I  know  it  is  not  a  mean  achievement.  However,  I  really  thank  the \\npeople of Gitanga, Chachune, Mutomo, Kibwea, Mathima, Muoga, Kanziko, Simisi, Kasala, \\nIkutha, Athi and Maluma. Thank you so much. I promise to do my best to deliver the promises \\nthat I made. \\n\\n This is one of the elections that I made the highest number of promises. I have never \\nmade the kind of promises I did in any other elections. With the help of God, the power that \\nthis House has, and the blessings of the people, I will deliver. \\n\\n I also take this opportunity to thank those who volunteered to support me. Some closed \\ntheir business in Nairobi and came to the ground to help me. The youth, women and to all of \\nthem, I say thank you so much and may God bless you.  \\n\\nHon. Temporary Speaker, allow me to go to today’s Motion. It is a very important one, \\nand addresses the matter of coming up with  a policy that will ensure that we have a school \\nfeeding program.  \\n\\nMy  constituency,  Kitui  South,  is  one  of  the  most  affected  in  the  country.  We  have \\nchildren who are not attending school. Some have already dropped out because there is no food \\nat home. Some are assisting their parents to get money by working here and there so that they \\ncan get food.  \\n\\nHaving  this  policy  will  ensure  that  we  get  a  way  of  ensuring  that  we  have  healthy \\nchildren who will be able to perform better in school. This will ensure that we have children \\ntransiting  from  primary,  secondary  and  possibly,  to  tertiary  institutions.  This  will  bring \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

So, by having this policy, it will eventually and \\nhopefully,  become  an  Act  of  Parliament  and  will  one  day  get  funded  just  like  the  other \\nprograms that have passed through this House. I hope we will get there. Health is wealth. The \\nbiggest  wealth that we have in  this country is  our children. Beyond provision  of electricity, \\nroads and everything that we do, our children are number one.  \\n\\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  we  need  to  have  this  policy  as  soon  as  possible  after  this \\nMotion is passed by this House. Once the policy is passed, we could think of identifying ways \\nwhere the sourcing of food is done from local areas. When this happens, we will promote small \\nbusinesses  within  those  communities  and  eventually  develop  the  small  business  men  and \\nwomen within the local areas. \\n \\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  we  have  a  very  good  Non-Governmental  Organisation \\n(NGO) in my constituency called Homegrown, that has done very well in terms of providing \\nfood in some of the schools. We are engaging to see whether we can get more. However, it is \\nimportant to note that most NGOs that are providing food are also calling upon the Government \\nto come up with proper policies and plans so that the Government itself can finance this. This \\nmatter has been raised by Homegrown, another Organization called Food for Education, East \\nChildrens’ Fund and Mary Hill. This matter that our colleague is raising, also resonates very \\nwell with the NGOs that are asking that we have proper policies, rules and regulations. That \\nwe have a proper financing that can eventually ensure that our children are getting food. \\n \\nIf  this  happens,  it  will  ensure  that  the  children  in  my  constituency  are  able  to  go  to \\nschool. The stories that I am getting from my constituency are really disheartening, but we have \\na situation where teachers are bringing concentrated tea – that is tea with a lot of sugar - so that \\nduring break time, if they realise that some of the children are getting frail, then they can give \\nthem that tea so that it can sustain them. It is time that this August House raises to the occasion \\nto ensure that we have this policy and that we take other steps to ensure sustainable financing. \\nAs my colleagues have spoken, the Member for Wajir and the Hon. Member for Mbeere East, \\nsustainability is critical. It is time we know that yes, we are going to feed the children now until \\nthe near future, hopefully, if we get that policy. The issue is about ensuring that provide water \\nin especially those Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs). When we have water, then we will get \\nsustainable food production and feed the children. \\n \\nHon. Temporary Speaker, my last point will be a call to our principals and headteachers \\nin our schools that: This is a very difficult moment. We would like to ask them as Parliament \\nthat, if possible, they come up with some form of agreements with the suppliers. This is because \\nI walked into a market place in my constituency in Mutomo and I saw children in uniforms \\nfrom various secondary schools. All of them were being sent home for school fees. Yes, we do \\nnot have National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF) and most of those \\nchildren depend on it. I would like to call upon the headteachers and principals to kindly give \\nthe  House  a  chance.  Engage  the  suppliers  of  food.  Kindly  keep  the  children  in  school  and \\nhopefully in the very near future, the matter of NG-CDF will be sorted out and it will assist \\nyou to pay the bills.  \\n \\nthe opportunity to speak. May God bless you.  \\n \\nThe next chance will go to the Hon. Member for Yatta, Hon. Robert Basil. \\nHon. Robert Ngui (Yatta, WDM-K): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. Allow me \\n \\nto thank you for being in the Panel and for serving us today. I also want to thank Hon. Speaker \\nand  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker.  I  thank  the  Yatta  people  for  voting  for  me  as  their  Member  of \\nParliament (MP). It was not an easy walk. More so, people queued for long hours to cast their \\nvotes in my favour. The way to thank them is actually to serve them. I also take this moment \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you too for your kind words. \\n\\nHon.

More so, the First Lady of Yatta Madam Jackline \\nKagia.  \\n\\nKey  issues  in  my  constituency  include  the  road  infrastructure.  Yatta  has  been \\nmarginalised for long. You can imagine Hon. Temporary Speaker, we have people who have \\nnever seen a tarmac road, particularly when  you talk of the key roads: Kilimani to Katangi, \\nMatuu to Katangi and Ndalani To Makuyu. These are very essential roads to open the economy \\nto Yatta constituency.  \\nAnother  important  thing  to  recognise  is  the  cost  of  living,  which  is  above  the  roof. \\n \\nCurrently,  we  can  talk  of  maize  retailing  at  Kshs6,000  per  a  90-kilogramme  bag  in  Yatta \\nConstituency when in 2017 it was retailing at Kshs2,400. Most of the people are earning less \\nthan  a  dollar  in  a  day.  These  are  key  concerns  which  the  Government  needs  to  take  into \\nconsideration. Another important thing to factor in is the Yatta Dam. This has been a talk for \\ndecades. It is very key that we have a dam because many people will get water through it. Also \\nof key importance is the desilting of Yatta Canal which is serving so many people in Yatta. \\nToday  in  Yatta,  we  should  be  exporting  crops.  But  we  are  not  because  water  supply  is  not \\nguaranteed. \\n \\nWe need to have a Huduma Centre to support the Yatta and Masinga people. That is \\nbecause the majority of the people in Yatta and Masinga are relying on the Huduma Centre in \\nMachakos  and  they  have  to  travel  far;  a  distance  which  costs  more  than  Kshs300  one  way. \\nSomething to remember is unemployment, which has shot over the roof. Most of the youth are \\nleaving  schools  and  are  walking  with  papers,  but  there  are  no  jobs.  They  have  certificates, \\ndiplomas and degrees, but have no work. Therefore, the Government needs to take this into \\nconsideration to open the economy and absorb people who are leaving schools. We also have \\nteachers who are waiting to be employed and you can imagine someone tarmacking until they \\nare  40  years  without  being  employed.  The  only  thing  they  have  is  a  Teachers’  Service \\nCommission (TSC) number. This is something that the Government needs to reconsider. \\n \\nWith regard to title deeds in Yatta, we have thousands if not hundreds of thousands of \\npeople who are squatters and most of them need tittle deeds. We are talking of 59 years since \\nKenya attained self-rule and there are people without title deeds. The Government should take \\nthis into consideration. It is a pertinent issue in Yatta. \\n\\nSomething  that  I  want  to  bring  to  the  attention  of  the  House  is  electricity.  We  have \\nmany schools and villages without electricity. As their MP, I would love the Government to \\ntake into consideration more about the rural electrification program.  \\n\\nBack to the Motion, I want to contribute meaningfully because a Motion to do with a \\nschool feeding program is very essential. I am a beneficiary of “Maziwa ya Nyayo” and our \\npupils  should  enjoy  school  feeding  programs  because  this  contributes  to  Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) 3 and 4 on Equality, Quality Education as well as Good Health \\nand Well-Being.   \\n \\nThis is a Motion I fully support. It is going to shoulder the burden that parents are going \\nthrough to be able to raise or pay for food in schools for their kids. It is also going to boost \\nretention and we cannot ignore. Therefore, this is a Motion I fully support and I hope that we \\ncan  entrench  the  school  feeding  program  in  the  NG-CDF  so  that,  at  least,  we  can  have  it \\nbudgeted and money allocated to provide food to school-going children.  \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I did not have a chance to contribute to the Presidential debate. \\nHowever, something caught my eye. When you talk about the Hustler Fund, my question is: \\nAre we trying to baptise Uwezo Fund and call it Hustler Fund? Uwezo Fund tends to serve the \\nsame function as what the Hustler Fund is intended. What was wrong with Uwezo Fund which \\nmotivated the Head of State to bring the Hustler Fund? This is something we need to look into \\nso that we can take lessons learnt from Uwezo Fund to inform the Hustlers Fund. Otherwise, it \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I rest my case. \\nThe  Temporary  Speaker  (Hon.  (Ms.)  Martha  Wangari):  Thank  you.  Member  for \\n\\nwill be a duplication of efforts by creating another Fund which will serve the same purpose and \\nfunction as the Uwezo Fund. \\n \\nOn matters to do with corruption, as a Member of Parliament, I have noticed that Kenya \\nhas slowed down on this. We have seen people accused or with standing cases of graft finding \\nthemselves  in  elective  positions  and  others  landing  in  very  juicy  appointments  in  the \\nGovernment. So, it is important for our Government to tell us what they are doing differently \\nfrom the Jubilee Government in taming matters of corruption. \\nAs  a  Member  of  Parliament,  this  is  a  key  concern  because  if  corruption  was \\n \\nmeaningfully tamed like it has been in Singapore and Finland, then Kenya would be on the \\nmove  to  be  a  proper  middle-income  economy  like  other  nations  of  the  world.  This  will \\nguarantee the people leaving school will get  employment as opposed to  what we are seeing \\ntoday, which is a serious concern to all of us. So, we need to meaningfully look into this. \\n \\nLastly, I would like to recognise the most important and outstanding issue which came \\nfrom the President’s Speech. In No.28, he said that the Government will not borrow to fund \\nrecurrent expenditure. This was a good point because it is like borrowing money from a bank \\nto  pay  rent.  So,  when  he  said  the  Government  will  not  borrow  to  invest  on  recurrent \\nexpenditure, I fully support him on this. But, please, let us reconsider other matters. Otherwise, \\nwe are not doing well as a Government.  \\nYou can imagine the debt ratio in relation to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stands \\n \\nat 67.4 per cent. This is limiting the capacity of Government to invest in development and is \\none of the key contributors to the unemployment that we are seeing; which has shot through \\nthe roof.  \\n \\n \\nNakuru County. \\nHon.

For the sake of record, I am the Woman Representative \\nfor Turkana County. I wish to thank you for giving me this chance. I also thank the Almighty \\nGod for enabling me to  be in the august  House. It  was not  easy or a walk in the park but a \\ndifficult race. But God made it for me and I thank Him.  \\n\\nI thank the people of Turkana for trusting in me. We had great women in that race, but \\nthey chose me. That does not mean that I was better than others, but the favour and the grace \\nof God fell on me. I thank God for that.  \\n\\nI wish to congratulate His Excellency President William Samoei Ruto and his Deputy, \\nRigathi Gachagua, for being elected. I congratulate the Speaker, Moses Wetang’ula, and his \\nDeputy, Madam Gladys Boss Shollei. I extend my gratitude and congratulations to the leaders \\nof the upper House. Being a Kenya Kwanza Coalition member, I am proud that the Speakers \\nof the both Houses came from our Coalition. I am a happy legislative representative. \\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Ms.) Martha Wangari): The Hon. Member is making \\n\\nher maiden speech. She will not be interrupted but heard in silence. \\n\\nHon. (Ms.) Cecilia Ngitit (Turkana CWR, UDA): Hon. Temporary Speaker, I would \\nlike  to  thank  the  people  of  Turkana  County  starting  from  Turkana  Central,  Turkana  North, \\nTurkana West, Turkana South, Loima and Turkana East in that order. Those people humbled \\nme as I was campaigning; where I offered myself to them and gave them the promises that I \\nwished to deliver later on in this House. They trusted me, heard my word, believed in me and \\nelected me. I would like to thank them all. \\n\\nI also take this special chance to thank my family, beginning with my husband. I heard \\nthe  woman  governor  for  some  county  struggling  to  place  her  husband  as  the  county  first \\ngentleman, and I do not know how the husbands of the Women Representatives will be referred \\nto. I do not know if it is the county man or what it is. I thank my husband for supporting me. \\n\\nI  would  like  to  thank  a  clique  of  friends,  that  is  Warembo  na  Ishu.  I  also  thank  the \\nchurch  where  some  of  the  members  stood  with  me,  prayed  for  me,  and  fasted  for  my  sake. \\nThank you so much and may God bless you. \\n\\nTurkana  County  is  placed  in  a  very  unique  position.  We  border  three  international \\nboundaries,  that  is  Ethiopia,  South  Sudan  and  Uganda.  This  puts  Turkana  in  a  very \\nadvantageous position and disadvantageous one at the same time; especially on the insecurity \\nmatters where our boundaries expose us to external aggression. The Turkana people lose lives \\nand livestock to the neighbouring countries. Even internally, we are still vulnerable. Over the \\nweekend, I came from burying very eminent members of my society that we lost to banditry. \\nTurkana  County  is  one  vulnerable  county.  This  country  has  to  take  note  of  the  unique \\nchallenges that we go through. Apart from losing lives to the internal  conflicts, the external \\nones need to  be looked into.  It is  like  fighting an international  country like Ethiopia, South \\nSudan and Uganda, and there are no members of the army deployed in those boundaries. We \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It is my wish that for the first time, the \\nGovernment in place today will look into the special placement of Turkana so that the army is \\ndeployed in those international boundaries. \\n\\n About the banditry, we will have discussions going forward. It has become a menace \\nas it affects many counties here. Surprisingly, the perpetrators seem to come from one specific \\nplace. That is a discussion for another day. \\n\\nOn today’s Motion on school feeding programme, I want to admit that I am one of the \\nbeneficiaries of the programme. Were it not for the food in schools, I would not be here today. \\nBeing brought  from a poor county and poor family for that case,  I would only go to school \\nbecause  there  was  food.  By  good  chance,  I  got  to  learn  and  that  is  why  there  is  a  Woman \\nRepresentative for Turkana County today. A school feeding programme for those of us who \\ncome from drought-stricken counties is a key topic to be discussed. I congratulate the Member \\nof Parliament who has brought that Motion to the Floor of the House today and I support it. \\n\\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  as  we  speak  today,  drought  is  ravaging  our  counties, \\nespecially Turkana County. We have no land for farming. We only depend on livestock. When \\ndrought strikes, there is no pasture for our livestock. We go to nearby countries. For instance \\nnow, the Turkana people are in Uganda and South Sudan in search of pasture, and they are \\nexposed to external and international humiliation in those countries. At times, their livestock \\nremains  there  when  they  come  back  to  Kenya.  The  drought  topic  has  to  be  looked  into. \\nAlthough we cannot command rain, Kenya has to come up with ways or measures that will \\ncushion us so that next time that we have drought, we know what is supposed to be done. \\n\\nFor the school feeding program, Turkana County stands out as the most special county \\nthat needs to be fed. Not even schools alone, but even the adults. We lose people to hunger. \\nMany malnutrition cases are being reported in Turkana County. It is not about school feeding \\nalone  but,  extend  it  to  adult  feeding.  In  Turkana,  we  have  no  farms.  We  do  not  practice \\nagriculture  because  of  our  climatic  conditions.  It  is  not  our  liking.  If  we  had  good  climatic \\nconditions, and because we have expansive lands, we would be a county that is feeding this \\ncountry. But because our land is not arable, we are looking up to you people in upcountry to \\nfeed  Turkana  County  and  other  counties  like  Marsabit,  Samburu  and  some  places  in  North \\nEastern. \\n\\nI  am  so  delighted  to  speak  in  the  august  House  today  for  the  first  time  and,  going \\nforward, we will be contributing to various topics. I want to rely heavily on the promises that \\nmy party leader, the President of the Republic of Kenya, gave to Kenyans in a document called \\nThe Plan. In The Plan, all our needs have been mentioned there. All our problems have their \\nsolutions there. I know that being the action-oriented leader that he is, he will deliver.   \\n\\nWith  regards  to  the  National  Government  Affirmative  Action  Fund  (NGAAF)  for \\nvulnerable groups, I heard the President assure women leaders of this country many times that \\nhe will deliberately enhance that Fund so that it can reach out to many hustlers down there. \\nThey are still looking forward to that.   \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. God bless Kenya, God bless Turkana. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari):  Thank you. I also note that if you \\nare making your maiden speech, please inform the House. You will be heard in silence. Points \\nof order are not permitted when you are making your maiden speech. I want to make that clear, \\nbecause Hon. Raso was out of order in the first place.   \\n\\nThe next Member to speak is the Member for Keiyo South, Hon. Gideon Kimaiyo. \\nHon. George Kariuki (Ndia, UDA): On a point of order, Hon. Temporary Speaker.   \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): What is your point of order, Hon. \\n\\nGK from Ndia? \\n\\nHon.  George  Kariuki  (Ndia,  UDA):    Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  we  have  Members \\nwho have not had an opportunity to address the House or to contribute to Motions in the House.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c13th October 2022                       NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               42 \\n\\nI have been seated here for the last seven days. So, for five hours every day, I have not had an \\nopportunity to address the House.  I request that you limit the time per Member from 10 to five \\nminutes, so that we all get an opportunity to say something. It is  unfortunate that although I \\nwas very prepared to say something or contribute to the President’s Speech, I did not get an \\nopportunity, even after sitting here and waiting for five hours per day.  \\n Kindly, Hon. Temporary Speaker, limit the time per Member. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. GK. Just hold on. \\nI want to make it clear that you cannot limit the time in the middle of a Motion; that will be \\nagainst the Standing Orders. That should have been done from the start. However, I also note \\nthat there are Members who have never spoken in Parliament.  If we would be magnanimous \\nenough,  more  of  us  would  get  an  opportunity  to  speak.  That  is  why  we  have  extended  this \\nSitting up to 9.00 O’clock tonight so that we give as many Members as possible a chance to \\nspeak. When you are given a chance to speak for 10 minutes, you do not have to use all of it. \\nYou can use two or five minutes, and more Members will get a chance to talk. \\n\\n Let us go to the Member for Keiyo South, Hon. Gideon Kimaiyo. \\nHon. Gideon Kimaiyo (Keiyo South, UDA):  Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. \\nMine  is  not  a  maiden  speech,  but  I  want  to  contribute  to  the  Motion  on  the  school-feeding \\npolicy. At Independence, our forefathers talked about three problems; ignorance, disease and \\npoverty. However today, we still face the same problems. The Motion by the Hon. Member for \\nKakamega addresses the issue of education.   \\n\\nThe United Nations (UN) did some research on 10 problems that will affect humanity \\nin the next 10 years. Amongst them were education, democracy, environment, terrorism, war, \\nand water. They highlighted solutions for all these issues. Education was key in addressing all \\nthese issues. I have gone to school hungry, so I know what it took for the Member of Parliament \\n(MP) to  come up with this  Motion. It  has taken true miracles for me to  go to  school.  I was \\neducated by the late Hon. Nicholas Biwott.  I dropped out of school when I was in Form Three. \\nWhen  campaigning,  I  promised  my  constituents  that  we  will  establish  a  school-feeding \\nprogramme. So, this Motion is personal to me.   \\n\\nWhen  I  came  to  this  House  this  afternoon,  I  was  the  first  one  to  log  in.    I  was  first \\nbecause this is personal to me. As we contribute to this Motion, I hope that one day, the school-\\nfeeding  programme  will  not  only  be  an  Act  of  Parliament,  but  will  also  be  anchored  in  the \\nConstitution in such a way that when we talk about free primary education, there will be an \\nelement of food in it. This is so that we do not just talk about free primary education, yet we \\nstill have children who are suffering because there is no food. \\n\\nThere is  hunger problem in  areas of Kerio  Valley  in  Keiyo South  Constituency. We \\nthank  the  World  Vision  International  for  doing  something  about  it;  but  that  is  a  Non-\\nGovernmental Organisation (NGO). In previous Parliaments, this Motion was tabled, and the \\nGovernment shot it down because they said that there was no money to cater for it. I believe \\nthat there is money. If we can arrange to have the Government, NGOs, and the World Food \\nProgramme (WFP) come together, we can have the money to sustain this programme. This is \\na noble and timely idea.   \\n\\nLet me address the importance of this programme. One, is that we will have improved \\nperformance  in  school.  It  will  also  bring  equity.  Currently,  we  are  talking  about  the \\nCompetency Based Curriculum (CBC), but when it comes to requirements for schools to cater \\nfor  the  CBC,  children  in  private  schools  are  more  advantaged  than  those  in  public  primary \\nschools, where they cannot even afford a basic meal.  \\n\\n This programme will also improve the health of our children. We will no longer see \\nmalnourished children in places where they cannot afford food. In the long run, it will assist \\nwith  the  issue  of  poverty.  Education  will  be  an  equaliser  for  everybody,  whether  you  come \\nfrom a rich or a poor family. We are talking about hustlers in the new regime. When we talk \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It  is  a timely programme since it will address  hustlers, who \\nform the larger part of this country. Once children have food, they will concentrate more in \\nschool, and this will improve their performance.   \\n\\nWhen I was campaigning in my Constituency, I promised them this programme. I did \\nnot know that one or two weeks down the line in Parliament, this Motion would be tabled.  I \\nthank  the  MP  for  bringing  it.  I  assure  my  constituents  that  I  am  a  firm  believer  in  this \\nprogramme  to  feed  our  children  in  school.  I  ask  the  Government  to  ensure  that  schools, \\nespecially primary schools, have empty land. If we say that the school-feeding programme is \\nexpensive, we can tailor-make it in such a way that empty land in schools is used to plant maize \\nand beans, which will reduce the cost. \\n\\n In  day-secondary  schools,  a  child  pays  Ksh1,000  for  meals  every  term.  The \\nGovernment promised free day-secondary education, but they still pay Ksh9,000 per year. If \\nthis programme is introduced, it will cater for those meals, and free day-secondary schools will \\nbe a reality, and not the one that we have today where parents still go to their pockets.  \\n\\nIn my Constituency, we sat down with stakeholders in the education sector to look at \\nhow  to  make  day-secondary  schools  free  without  parents  going  to  their  pockets  to  pay  this \\nKsh1,000 every month. I believe this programme will make day-secondary schools free.  \\n\\nWith those few remarks, Hon. Temporary Speaker, I support this Motion.  \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you. The next speaker will \\n\\nbe the Member for Dagoretti North, Hon. Beatrice Elachi. \\n\\nHon. Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. \\nBefore I start, I want to congratulate you. I thank the Almighty God because as girls who were \\nmentored by Mwai Kibaki we still keep our values. \\n\\nThis is a Motion that is so dear to my heart. I want to thank Stanbic Bank for starting \\nthe  programme  in  my  constituency.  I  am  able  to  feed  Gatina  Primary  School.  We  are  still \\nnegotiating for Muslim Primary School and Kawangware Primary School as I prepare to launch \\nthe kitchen programme to feed at least 15,000 children in school every day at lunch time. I also \\nwant to thank Hon. Kiarie, Hon. Mohamed Ali, Hon. Milemba and Hon. Aseka. This team has \\nmade us proud. They are able to feed children within their constituencies. There is a wonderful \\ngirl called Wawira who right now is feeding 80,000 children across different counties. I also \\nwant  to  thank her and her Food for Education initiative. She has a vision which  I hope this \\nHouse will follow to ensure that we have food for our children. \\n\\nThe most interesting thing is that we tend to ignore the fact that when the 13 ASAL \\ncounties face hunger, Nairobi is hit so badly. And I am not saying this in bad faith. You will \\nfind children running all over shopping centres looking for food after school,  which is  very \\ndangerous.  This  programme  serves  to  retain  children  in  school.  It  also  ensures  that  we \\nsafeguard our children so that they are not used to peddle drugs. At Lavington Arcade, a child \\nis given a parcel to send to someone and they do not look inspect it because they want their \\nKsh100 to take home. Many grown-ups in Nairobi use children within shopping malls to peddle \\ndrugs. We need to deal with that. \\n\\nI want to thank Mama Elsie Muhanda, our leader and mother who has held most of us \\nfrom Kakamega together, for thinking as a mother. This is what parents need for their children. \\nTo even have good grades, you need to be fed. We know very well that when a child is hungry, \\nthat  child  will  be  so  helpless  in  class  and  will  never  concentrate.  We  should  pick  this \\nprogramme. We should look at the CDF Act and entrench it in the Constitution. The Ksh1.6 \\nbillion  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  using  should  come  through  the  constituencies  to  feed \\nchildren. If used well, that money is enough to feed nearly all children in the 290 constituencies. \\nParents will only need to subsidise maybe with Ksh5 or Ksh6. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

When \\nyou look at urban areas like Nakuru, Nairobi Kisumu and Mombasa, if we are not careful we \\nare going to lose a lot of our children. They are about to close school in the next one month. I \\nam  imagining  what  is  going  to  explode  in  Nairobi,  Nakuru,  Kisumu  and  other  urban  areas \\nwhere children will be after closing schools for two months. They will wonder what to do. \\n\\nI  know  the  regulations  on  supplying  food  were  strict,  but  I  want  to  as  the  Principal \\nSecretary  for  Special  Programmes,  Mr.  Nelson  Marwa,  to  have  mercy  on  urban  areas  and \\ndistribute food to schools. Those who are able to cook can do so in their schools. This will help \\nchildren, especially those in Standard Eight, Grade Six and Form Four who are going to do \\ntheir exams very soon. It will ensure they settle in class, concentrate and perform.  \\n\\nThis Motion is going to save all of us. I believe there is a framework already. The same \\nframework  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  using  to  disburse  Kshs1.6B  billion  is  the  same \\nframework we can enhance. We can look at the regulations and ensure they are clear to guide \\nschool feeding programme in this country. The President went to Dagoretti South when he was \\ncampaigning  and  saw  the  kitchen  programme.  I  believe  it  is  in  his  interest  and  that  of  the \\nGovernor to ensure we work together in Nairobi. I plead with legislators from other counties \\nto work together with county assemblies to ensure we feed our children.  \\n\\nIf we can ensure we retain children in school, we can then deal with the parents. For \\nnow, it is so difficult to talk to a parent who is about to sleep hungry. That is why you meet a \\nchild in a shopping centre at 9 or 10 o’clock at night. When you pick and take them to their \\nhouse,  you  realise  they  were  going  to  sleep  hungry  because  they  had  nothing.  It  is  not  that \\npeople are taking advantage, but there is a big challenge in the country brought by drought and \\nCovid-19 pandemic. Many Kenyans are sleeping hungry. \\n\\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  with  those  few  remarks,  I  beg  to  support.  Thank  you  and \\n\\ncongratulations. \\n\\nHon. Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North, ODM): Thank you for your kind words. The \\nnext speaker will be the Member for Kieni, Hon. Anthony Wainaina. If he is not in the House, \\nthe chance will go to the Member for Bureti Hon. Kibet Komingoi. \\n\\nHon. Kibet Komingoi (Bureti, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. I think \\nit is easier to please voters in Kenya than to please the Speaker. I have been here for several \\ndays,  waiting  for  a  chance  to  speak  and  make  my  maiden  speech.  I  thank  you  for  this \\nopportunity. \\n\\nIt pleased God and the people of Bureti to elect me. I am very grateful to the people of \\nBureti  in  all  the  wards—Tebesonik,  Cheboin,  Kapkatet,  Cheplanget,  Chemosot,  Litein  and \\nKisiara—who gave us an overwhelming victory to be in this Parliament. \\n\\nI will not belabour the point. I want to talk about the issues that we will be addressing \\nin Bureti. Some of them were covered in the President’s speech. Bureti Constituency is one of \\nthe  constituencies  with  no  tap  water.  We  will  be  looking  forward  to  implementation  of  the \\nwater projects promised by the Kenya Kwanza team.  \\n\\nTwo, we are looking forward to  engaging on construction of infrastructure in  Bureti \\nConstituency.  There  are  roads  that  need  to  be  tarmacked,  including  Chebwagan-Kabala, \\nBoguiyot-Kapkisiara  and  Chelilis-Ketarwet-Charera  roads.  We  hope  in  five  years,  this \\ngovernment will see these developments through. On education, we hope that the government \\nwill reconsider some of its plans because the teachers of Bureti have been asking me. I am sure \\nsome of you Members have also received the same sentiments about the abuse or the failed \\ndelocalisation programmes. We are hoping that teachers will be sent back to their communities \\nto teach there and retire from their homes.  \\nThirdly, we have issues of the urban areas of Bureti. For all the programmes that will \\n \\nbe set out within the plan, we are praying and hoping in the hustler and the bottom-up approach \\nthat the UDA Party and the Kenya Kwanza Government is seeking to implement.. We hope it \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

One of the critical  things we  are looking into is \\ndecriminalisation of work so that we may have all people doing whatever is legal in order to \\nearn  a  living.  One  of  the  things  we  are  seeking  and  will  want  in  the  health  sector  is  the \\nupgrading of the Kapkatet District Hospital. We want the upgrading of drainages at Kapkatet \\ntowns and the Kapkatet Stadium, which we have been looking into for several years.  \\n \\nAbout the Motion on the table,  I support school  feeding programme.  I  am  hearing  a \\nmisnomer about drought in various regions. While there are places in this country that are not \\nfacing drought, they are still facing food shortages. In our villages, however much we say we \\nreceive rains in Kericho and its environs, there are homes and people who sleep without food. \\nWe  must  also  consider  this  -  providing  food  and  creating  investments  in  agriculture  so  that \\nfood is provided. On the food programme, my submission is that we give priority to food grown \\nwithin the regions so that we do not import food for the children we are seeking to feed in our \\nschools. \\nI agree with the Hon. Member for Dagoretti North, that included in the basic primary \\n \\neducation should be the feeding programme. The feeding programme should also be included \\nin  National  Government  Constituency  Development  Fund  (NG-CDF)  programmes  that  we \\nhave so as to carter for the disadvantaged in communities. One thing we must understand is \\nthat however  rich communities may be, or however wet  lands may be because they  receive \\nrainfall,  there  are  pockets  of  people  in  our  societies  who  are  experiencing  deficits  on  food. \\nThere are people who are actually poor that they cannot afford food for their children and for \\nthemselves.  It  is  our submission that this Motion be approved so that we see how it  can be \\nimplemented.  \\n \\nFinally, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to give this maiden speech, and to \\nremind ourselves to let justice and fairness be the guiding principle in our debates. Let the time \\nfor logging in also matter so that we do not have people sitting here for too long before they \\nget an opportunity to speak. Otherwise, Hon. Temporary Speaker, thank you very much.   \\n \\nwill be the Member for Khwisero, Hon. Christopher Aseka. \\nHon.  Christopher  Wangaya  (Khwisero,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary \\n \\nSpeaker, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this Motion. First, let me congratulate \\nyou for being part of the Speaker’s Panel. I congratulate our Speaker, Hon. Moses Wetangula, \\nand the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Gladys Boss Shollei. Let me also take this opportunity to thank \\nthe great people of Khwisero Constituency for giving me an opportunity to serve them for the \\nsecond term. Since Khwisero was hived off from Butere in 1997, through the grace of God, I \\nam  the  first  privileged  Member  of  Parliament  to  be  re-elected  to  this  august  House.  My \\ncommitment to them and my priority remains to support our education sector to see to it that \\nour children get better out of every programme.  \\n \\nThe school feeding programme is real and happening in Khwisero. I initiated it in 2018, \\nwhen we realised that economic and social challenges facing our people were spilling over to \\nour children. We came up with a basic meal of maize and beans for all candidates in all public \\nprimary schools. It is not easy; it is something that requires a lot of attention and it has serious \\nfinancial implications. But, as a Christian, we say service to humanity is service to God.  \\nHon. Temporary Speaker, I will only share the positives we have witnessed in Khwisero \\n \\nfor the last five years. The rate of school attendance went up, especially for the candidates. The \\ncontact hours between teachers and pupils increased because you only need 30 minutes to serve \\nlunch  in  a  day,  and  save  another  45  minutes  for  some  other  supportive  activities.  This  has \\nenabled teachers to go through their syllabus revision. We have seen improved performance in \\nour schools.                                 \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Hon. Members, the next speaker \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The \\n \\nattendance and the concentration in class has gone up. We have been able to transit as many \\nstudents as possible from primary to secondary schools. It has also made burdens on parents \\neasier. At times in the villages every afternoon, as you know, every woman and father needs to \\ngo  back  home  and  prepare  lunch  for  their  children.  If  we  have  this  programme  in  schools, \\nparents will utilise that time in some more profitable economic activities. \\n \\nLastly, so that I allow new Members to make their maiden speeches, Members have \\nargued about the sustainability of this programme. It is about strategy on how to do it. What \\nwe are doing from next year is capitalising on our primary schools. As a foundation, we are \\ngiving  inputs  those  that  have  big  tracts  and  chunks  of  land.  We  are  supporting  them  with \\nfertilisers and certified seeds so that they produce within the schools. We are also reaching out \\nto NGOs to come in and support.  \\n \\nAs I finish, let us align and translate this Motion into an Act of Parliament. Despite the \\nfinancial challenges and problems within the country, we can allow and open up the NG-CDF \\nAct through the amendment we want to bring to the Floor. That will allow us to spend on this \\nrecurrent expenditure over and above the infrastructure that we are doing. Then every MP will \\nhave a provision to budget for this noble programme within the NG-CDF.  \\n \\nLastly, I promise the people of Khwisero that infrastructural developments in schools \\nwill continue. In collaboration with the national and county government, I will prioritise putting \\nup  a  Khwisero  Level  Four  hospital,  and  operationalisation  of  the  Khwisero  Technical  and \\nTraining Institute.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Hon. Member, thank you for your \\n\\n \\ncompliments.  \\n\\nThe next speaker will be the Member for West Pokot County, Hon. Rael Kasiwai.   \\nHon. Rael Kasiwai (West Pokot County, KUP): Thank you for this golden opportunity \\n \\nto make my first speech in Parliament since independence. I congratulate the Speaker, Hon. \\nMoses Wetang’ula, and the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Gladys Boss, in absentia, for their election. \\nI believe in them and they are going to deliver in the 13th Parliament. I also want to congratulate \\nyou  for  carrying  out  the  days’  programme.  I  am  a  Christian  and  a  strong  Catholic  for  that \\nmatter. Therefore, I thank the Almighty God for giving me and all of us good health and for \\nthe peaceful elections. It was the most peaceful election ever.  \\n\\nI  thank  the  people  of  West  Pokot  for  overwhelmingly  voting  me  as  their  County \\nMember of Parliament; more so, the people of Kacheliba, Sigor, South Pokot and Kapenguria \\nconstituencies. I want to promise them that I am going to serve them diligently and with a lot \\nof dedication.  \\n\\nI also want to thank all my fellow teachers in my county. They supported me because \\nthey had a lot of confidence in me. Wherever they are, I promise that I am going to support \\nMotions that promote education. Our county is one of those marginalised counties where the \\ngirl child is still not considered important. I promised the women of West Pokot that I am going \\nto work hard to ensure that the economy goes up using the NGAAF. Although the NGAAF \\nissue is a real problem because it has very little money, we hope that the current Government \\nis going to do something about it. This is because the women, youth and people living with \\ndisabilities are the majority in our society, yet they are given very little money. I want to urge \\nWomen Members of Parliament in this House to urge the President to do something about it. \\nThose people expect so much from us, and yet the money allocated to us is very little.  \\n\\nWest Pokot is one of the counties with many challenges. In the media, you saw that it \\nis one of the counties hard hit by drought. Although we have two sub counties doing farming, \\nthe other two – Sigor and Kacheliba constituencies – are arid areas. People living in those two \\nconstituencies are pastoralists because they cannot do farming due to lack of rain. So, they have \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It has resulted to \\ninsecurity  and  conflicts  with  the  neighbouring  communities  as  they  compete  for  the  same \\nresources. I hope that the President is going to do something on the same so that my people in \\nthose two constituencies are assisted.  \\n\\n I want to thank the Hon. Member who came up with this Motion. As I said earlier, I \\nam a teacher by profession. So, the Member had teachers and my county in mind. That is where \\nthere is real problem of school dropouts due to lack of food in schools. I would like to support \\nthe Motion tabled by the Member.  I am  a beneficiary of this programme which was there a \\nlong time ago, like the Nyayo Milk. That milk was very sweet. It made us look forward to going \\nto school. I do not know where the rain started beating us that caused such programmes to stop. \\nI thank this House because everybody who has spoken is supporting it.  \\n\\nThe school feeding programmes have a lot of benefits to our schools. One of them being \\nretention of learners in schools. In West Pokot County, children go to school because of that \\nfood.  Sometimes  it  is  given  by  the  WFP  and  other  NGOs.  But  that  amount  of  food  is  not \\nenough. So, it can be given for two to three days and then it gets finished. Children then go \\nback home to stay. Another importance of having these programmes in schools is that it reduces \\ninfamous behaviours in children, such as stealing from each other. When children are given the \\nsame amount of food and all of them are fed uniformly, there will be no stealing on the premise \\nthat others have while others may not have food.  \\n\\nBy giving meals in schools, the performance in examinations will improve. Children \\nare  going  to  be  in  school  most  of  their  time.  They  will  have  enough  time  to  revise,  hence \\nimproving their results. I have practically seen it, and it is the reason why I support this Motion. \\nIt also helps those learners from poor households to go to school. In West Pokot County, most \\nparents  do not have food due to  poor rains.  So,  having  food in  schools  will help  keep such \\nchildren in schools.  \\n\\nThe school feeding programmes will tremendously improve the health of learners. We \\nall know that a healthy nation is a wealthy nation. Malnutrition could be done away with hence \\nwe  shall  have  a  healthy  nation  in  the  long  run.  The  school  feeding  programme  has  a  lot  of \\nimportance and I cannot mention all of them. I hope we will fully implement it. I hope we are \\nnot just going to debate about it and leave it here. We hope the Government will do something \\nso that this programme is fully implemented in our schools to ensure our children go to school.  \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Hon. Member, your time is up. The \\n\\nnext speaker is the nominated Member, Hon. Suleka Harun. \\n\\nHon.  Suleka  Harun  (Nominated,  UDM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker  for \\ngiving me this opportunity. First, allow me to congratulate the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker \\nfor their election in this House, and also your election as a Member of the Chairpersons’ Panel. \\nHon. Temporary Speaker, I am new to this House courtesy of the United Democratic \\nMovement  (UDM)  party.  I  thank  them  for  having  trust  me,  and  nominating  me  to  this  13th \\nParliament. Additionally, it will not be fair if I do not express my gratitude to the electorates \\nwho elected a good number of MPs to this House. Were it not for their support, I would not \\nhave  been  here  today.  In  the  same  regard,  I  understand  that  I  am  the  first  woman  to  be \\nnominated to this House from Mandera County, and I take pride in that. \\n\\nI would like to support the Motion on the development of the school feeding policy to \\nsupport the government’s efforts in ensuring that there is increased access, retention, transition \\nand completion rate across the country, especially in the ASALs. I believe that school meals \\nwill be a major priority.  The school meals programme provides students with nutritional meals \\nthat children need to develop and stay healthy in schools. For many children, a school meal is \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

If well-balanced, these meals can eliminate the negative health \\neffects. These school meals are prepared by locals and this helps the children to stay connected \\nto  their  local  cultures.  They  also  provide  support  to  local  farmers.  The  best  school  meal \\nprogrammes are community-based, as they provide financial support to the local farmers. In \\ndoing so, they help generate economic activities, they allow farmers to improve their operations \\nand  expand  their  local  agriculture.  They  also  ensure  that  children  receive  fresh  and  healthy \\nnutrients on a daily basis. \\n\\nIt is also evident that food security has influence on the participation of nomadic pupils \\nin schools as well as improving their learning outcomes.  To celebrate and sustain these efforts, \\nI  support  the  development  of  the  school  feeding  policy  that  will  give  a  structured  and \\nsustainable delivery of these interventions. My prayer is that we do not leave it at this, but make \\nsure that this is implemented. This policy is of great importance to our children and we cannot \\nleave it at this. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member.  \\nNext is the Member for Seme, Hon. (Dr.) James Nyikal. \\nHon.  (Dr.)  James  Nyikal  (Seme,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  for \\ngiving me this opportunity. I also take this opportunity to congratulate you for being appointed \\nto the Chairpersons’ Panel. I appreciate the effort you are making in getting our new Members \\nto speak. The panel is doing well. As it has been the practice, even when you became a Member, \\nmy suggestion would be to advise the Members to come as early as possible and key in, and \\nthen  you  follow  that  order.  If  that  does  not  work,  at  least  Members  will  feel  that  it  is  their \\nclocking in time that matters, not just your choice. That is just a by-the-way. \\n\\nOn  this,  I  have  waited  this  long,  because  I  want  to  support  this  Motion.  As  a \\npaediatrician,  I  not  only  see  this  as  an  educational  problem,  but  as  a  child  health  and \\ndevelopment problem. This is because at the early stages that this occurs, particularly in early \\nchildhood  and  early  primary  education,  the  child’s  nutrition  is  extremely  important.  For \\nexample, the growth of the brain is vital at that time.  After that time, even with good nutrition, \\nthe growth would have stopped and, therefore, the children will not benefit. We should target \\nchildren at this stage. In fact, their cognitive functions will improve. Their performance – not \\nonly in exams, but also later in life – is significantly changed if there is good nutrition at this \\nstage in life. Not only that.  It is important even for their physical  growth. If there is lack of \\nnutrition  at  this  early  stage,  children  experience  stunted  growth,  particularly  the  female \\nchildren. When they get to puberty, they fail to have proper development growth with a lot of \\nobstetrical problems that they may face later on. I do not see this as an educational problem \\nonly, but  also  as a health problem  during the  critical  stage of  growth  and development  of a \\nchild. \\n\\nHon. Temporary Speaker, it is also of educational value, because if young children are \\nnot  well  fed,  they  have  shorter  attention  span;  their  blood  sugar  goes  low  and  they  cannot \\nfunction. So, they will be wasting time in schools if they are not properly fed. Proper meals are \\nextremely important to them. \\n\\nI support this because it is a practice that has been going on in this country. For the last \\n30 years, there has been disjointed attempts at school feeding programmes, and the Government \\nhas particularly concentrated on ASALs, where there is food insecurity. But again, to a large \\nextent, this has been done by NGOs, particularly the WFP. This programme covers about 1.2 \\nmillion children. However, this is not done in a structured manner. The Government spends up \\nto about Kshs.1.8 billion a year on this, but again not in a structured manner. You may be aware \\nthat  there  have  been  efforts  to  look  at  this  issue  in  a  more  integrated  manner  by  having \\ncommunity participation and home-grown solutions. However, this has not taken place. Why \\nhas this programme been on and off for 30 years? All of us have praised the Nyayo school milk \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The  problem  is  that  there  was  no  policy  foundation  or  a \\nbacking in law. Had that happened, the programme would still be going on.  \\nThis is an important function that will include both the national and county governments \\n \\nas  we  look  at  the  policy,  that  should  be  taken  into  consideration.  This  is  because,  the  most \\nserious implementation will involve the Early Childhood Development and Education (ECDE), \\nwhich is a county function; whereas the primary schools are a national Government function. \\nSo, there will be need for very serious coordination in this programme.  \\n\\nThis is particularly important for us, since we have episodes of food scarcity and food \\ninsecurity, like what is happening now.  Unfortunately for children, when one misses just one \\nlesson at a critical point of their education – for example, if this happens when they are studying \\nalgebra and the child is not able to go to school or to feed properly – even if they come back to \\nschool, it takes them too long to catch up. As you know, education is incremental. You build \\non  what  you  learnt  earlier.  If  you  missed  something,  you  cannot  catch  up.    It  is  extremely \\nimportant that this is done. \\nThis is why  I came to support this and I congratulate Hon. Muhanda.  If this Motion \\n \\npasses, I urge her to follow up on it. You and I have been in this House and have passed many \\nMotions,  but  you  know  that  very  few  are  implemented.  We  even  have  the  Committee  on \\nImplementation, but we do not see implementation. Therefore, for a keen Member like her, I \\nurge her to take this matter up and follow up on the policy to implementation. She should not \\njust leave it at policy level, but she should also bring it as a Sessional Paper back to this House.  \\nThe House will then discuss it and approve it.  After that, we can make it into law. It needs one \\ncommitted person as she is. When we have it like that, it is something that will be part and \\nparcel of the education  programme  which will be integrated, even in  national  development. \\nThe  food  that  we  buy  for  the  children  to  eat  should  come  from  our  farmers.  That  can  be \\nintegrated. We say that we should use the land in schools to produce food. That can also be \\nintegrated. You can see how broad this matter is. So, we need a policy, a sessional paper and \\neventually a law that will have the content, programmes and even the monetary part. \\n \\nWith those remarks, I, once again thank you. I know that it is stressing to get our new \\ncolleagues, but we would also like to make contribution. You can always get a balance, and I \\nthink you have done it well.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. I support the Motion.   \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member for your \\n\\ncompliment.  \\n\\nThe next chance will go to the Member for Othaya, Hon. Michael Wambugu Wainaina. \\nHon.  Michael  Wainaina  (Othaya,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker  for \\ngiving me this chance to speak to my people, who elected me overwhelmingly. First, I thank \\nthe people of Othaya Constituency for granting me this opportunity to serve them in this House. \\nI commit to work with them to make Othaya great. It is a Constituency that has its part in the \\nhistory of Kenya for being home of the third President of Kenya, His Excellency Mwai Kibaki. \\nMay his soul rest in eternal peace. As a way of honouring his input in this nation, I will work \\nextra  hard  to  ensure  that  Othaya  will  be  a  model  constituency  where  all  will  have  equal \\nopportunities.  Let  me  congratulate  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  and  all  the  Members  on \\nbeing elected to come to this House.  \\n\\nI will talk about the President’s speech. Let me start by congratulating the President and \\nhis  Deputy  for  their  well-deserved  victory.  Having  gone  through  the  speech,  I  want  to  talk \\nabout  the commitment to  implement  pledges,  and commitments which are set  out  in  Kenya \\nKwanza Manifesto. First, I look forward to seeing farmers, more so from Othaya, benefitting \\nfrom the plan which was laid out by our President in agriculture. Our significant intervention \\nis towards greater production with investment in irrigation water for the small-scale tea farmers \\nto scale up our productivity in agriculture.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

There is also a provision to access to cheap and sustainable funding for the targeted \\npopulation. Equally, the commitment by the President to inject Ksh50 billion to the Hustler \\nFund per year to enable small-scale traders to access affordable credit will go a long way in \\ncreating employment opportunities to our youth.  \\n\\nThe President committed to restructure National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). This \\nwill liberate Kenyans and their families from the threat of becoming poor every time a family \\nmember falls ill. I also concur with the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework to improve \\nour current infrastructure.  \\n\\nIn conclusion, I commit to support the Kenya Kwanza agenda in the House by bringing \\nlegislative proposals that are in line with our plan, and also help in making the lives of Kenyans \\nbetter. \\n \\nHon.  Temporary  Speaker,  I  support  this  Motion  on  the  Development  of  a  School \\nFeeding Policy.  I know how people are suffering in  my home area. When  I was in  primary \\nschool,  I  suffered  because  of  going  to  school  without  food.  I  know  how  those  people  are \\nsuffering and why we are there. This House can do a lot to save the lives of those people. My \\nconstituency has never experienced this kind of drought. Half of the people in my constituency \\nare suffering because they eat one meal a day.  \\n\\nWe need to support this Motion because people used to get food in schools in the 1970’s \\nand before. Kenya is growing, and we are where we are today. We need to support this Motion. \\nI saw some children going to school with some food and others without. That is why we are \\ngetting problems in our area. I support this Motion on Development of a School Feeding Policy, \\nso that those children who come from poor backgrounds can get food at school. \\n\\nI support this Motion. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. Martha Wangari): Thank you, Hon. Member.  \\nThe next Member will be the Member for Kitui West, Hon. Edith Nyenze. \\nHon.  Edith  Nyenze  (Kitui  West, WDM):  Thank you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  for \\ngiving me this opportunity to contribute. Let me take this opportunity to first thank God for \\nbeing re-elected the second time. Let me also thank the people of Kitui West  – Mutonguni, \\nKauwi,  Kwamutonga/Kithumula,  and  Matinyani  wards  –  for  re-electing  me.  As  I  promised \\nwhen I was campaigning, I will serve them with integrity and dedication. \\n\\nLet  me  also  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker, \\ntogether  with  your  team  for  this  opportunity  which  you  have  been  given  to  be  in  the \\nChairperson’s Panel. I served with you in a Committee, and I am sure that you will deliver. \\n\\nLet  me congratulate Hon. Elsie Muhanda for the good Motion on Development  of a \\nSchool Feeding Policy. Let me also contribute briefly on the School Feeding Programme which \\nwas identified from the 1980’s, to address, in short-term, the hunger in some areas. It worked \\nvery well, but it has not  been consistent. It is very useful in ensuring that the pupils get the \\nnutrients  which  they  require  so  much.  In  so  doing,  they  become  attentive  in  school.  It  also \\nensures that the students go to school because they know they will be fed. That improves their \\nperformance  and makes  the work of the teachers easy. They teach pupils who are well fed, \\nhealthy, happy and attentive. Without food, it will be difficult for teachers to even cover the \\nsyllabus, and also for the students to concentrate in school.  \\n\\nThe School feeding programmes should support the Government’s goal of education \\nfor all. There is almost 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary schools but with very \\npoor performance. We cannot talk of that transition and education for all if there is no food, \\nespecially in the ASAL areas. The school feeding programmes should target these areas and \\nensure that there is equality in our country. All children sit for the same examinations, yet some \\ncome  from  disadvantaged  areas  that  do  not  have  food.  This  means  there  is  no  equity.  The \\nGovernment should, therefore, have a programme for distributing food to the needy.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Sometimes fruits rot in farms and milk goes to waste because they are in excess. If there \\nwere good programmes, the food could be transported to the ASAL areas by the Government \\nduring harvesting season. Foods such as maize and beans  can be used to feed school  going \\nchildren. Similarly, we have areas that experience flooding, yet there are areas that do not have \\nwater.  The  Government  could  store  this  water,  store  food  and  initiate  good  plans  and \\nprogrammes to support people in disadvantaged regions. Efficient school feeding programmes \\ncan be done through proper policies, plans and Acts of Parliament.  \\n\\nI come from Kitui County, which is currently experiencing famine. It was reported two \\nweeks ago that four people died from hunger. This poses a threat not only to the school-going \\nchildren, but also to all people in general. I urge the Government to do something about it. We \\nsay it is good to be given the fishing rod and not the fish, but right now, we need fish in my \\ncounty, Ukambani in general and in other ASAL areas. The need is so urgent that we do not \\nhave to wait to see people die. As an MP, I distributed food to all the primary schools through \\nmy NGO.  I have 125 primary schools where I distributed maize and beans, but it is not enough. \\nDue to food scarcity, I have kept on urging teachers to work in partnership with the alumni of \\nthe schools, and contribute money to buy food, especially for primary schools. This however, \\nis not forthcoming because they are not empowered because of unemployment. This is a big \\nproblem. I urge the Government to come up with plans to embed the school feeding programme \\nin  the  NG-CDF.  We  are  the  ones  dealing  with  education  which  will  be  complete  with  this \\nprogramme.  In  doing  so,  the  performance  in  all  the  schools  will  improve.  I  also  urge  the \\nGovernment to declare hunger as a national disaster, to get assistance from various quarters. \\n \\n\\n[The Temporary Speaker (Hon. \\nMartha Wangari) left the Chair] \\n\\n[The Temporary Speaker (Hon. \\n\\nOmboko Milemba) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Some countries, more so the Asian countries like Dubai do not get rains. They can stay \\nfor years without rainfall. For us, if we go for two to three years, we experience famine. The \\nAsian countries, just like us, have plenty of minerals. We should have alternative sources of \\nresources and means to feed our country besides rainfall, since it is scarce.  \\n\\nHon. Temporary Speaker, with  those  remarks,  I  support the Hon. Member’s Motion \\n\\nbecause it is timely.  \\n\\nAbdirahman. Proceed. \\n\\nThank you. \\nThe  Temporary  Speaker  (Hon.  Omboko  Milemba):  Next  is  Hon.  Mohammed \\n\\nHon.

I also thank \\nthe  great  people  of  Lafey  Constituency  for  having  faith  in  me,  and  for  the  overwhelming \\nsupport they accorded me to represent them in the 13th Parliament of the Republic of Kenya.  \\n My  constituency  has  various  challenges,  with  security  being  the  major  challenge \\nbecause we border Somalia. This week, we had three terror incidences, the latest being early \\nyesterday morning in a place called Alungu. There was a terrorist attack at the Safaricom mast, \\nand one Kenya Police Reservist (KPR) was injured in the attack. We are yet to hear from the \\ncounty and regional security team  condemning the attack and assuring the residents of their \\nsafety. We urge the Government to move very fast to bring a lasting solution to this security \\nissue. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Temporary Speaker, I urge Government to develop a proper welfare for the KPR. \\nThis is because they are neither paid well nor insured, and yet they are in the frontline of the \\nterror and insecurity.   \\n\\nLafey Constituency is the only one that does not have a single tarmac road. It also has \\npoor electricity connectivity. It is the only one  which has headquarters with a population of \\nmore than 10,000 households, yet electricity is only connected to 200 households. That is how \\nserious it is.   A month ago, they  connected 197  households, and when  I  went  to the Kenya \\nPower (KP) to request for the other households to be connected, I was told that the meters were \\nout of stock. \\n\\n I come from an undeveloped constituency and soon, I will be bringing Statements and \\nMotions. I will urge the Members to support me, because the Constituency is lagging behind. \\nIt is a Constituency without a tarmack road, with scarcity of water and a lot of health issues in \\nthis century.  \\n\\nI want to thank the Member for coming up with this Motion, which is timely and at the \\nhour of need. The majority of the Lafey Constituency residents are pastoralist, and we are in a \\ndire drought  situation.  If we pass  this Motion, it will benefit the residents  of  Lafey because \\ntheir children will be considered for feeding programmes in their schools. This is because the \\nchildren walk for long distances to reach their destined schools, yet they do not get meals in \\nschool. \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I am in support of this Motion. Thank you. \\nHon. Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Farah Maalim): Very  well.  Next  is  Hon. Gichimu \\n\\nGithinji, the Member for Gichugu Constituency. \\n\\nHon. Gichimu Githinji (Gichungu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. Let \\nme start by appreciating and congratulating the leadership of this House, led by Hon. Moses \\nMasika Wetangula, the Speaker of the National Assembly; the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Boss; the \\nsix Chairpersons of the Speaker’s Panel who are also equal to the task; and the leadership of \\nthe House, both from the Majority and Minority sides. \\n\\nHon.  Temporary Speaker, being the first time I am contributing in the 13th Parliament, \\nlet me take this early opportunity to thank the great people of Gichugu Constituency who saw \\nit fit that I should come back to Parliament to represent them for a second consecutive term.  \\nThis shows that they have trust and confidence in my leadership. I promise them that I will not \\nlet them down. I will continue serving them with vigor and love for every part of Gichugu so \\nthat the constituency can move forward. I received overwhelming, support from  all the five \\nwards of Gichugu, namely Karumandi, Baragwi Kabare, Njukiini and Ngariama. I thank you \\nall.  \\n\\nLet me assure my constituents that I will continue to lobby for the completion of the \\non-going projects.  We have Musibi, the belt of Gichugu, which is a 95-kilometre road that I \\nstarted pushing when I got into Parliament. It has already started, and I will continue lobbying \\nfor  it.    There  is  also  the  issue  of  water  and,  of  course,  we  are  also  hoping  for  electricity \\nconnectivity, both from the national level and partnering with the county Government.  I am \\npushing  for  new  and  incomplete  projects.  I  was  able  to  move  Gichugu  from  60  per  cent \\nconnectivity to about 80 per cent. I am very optimistic that in this term, we might hit 90 or 100 \\nper cent. \\n\\nGoing back to  the Motion at  hand by the able Hon. Member for Kakamega County, \\nHon. Elsie Muhanda who has proved to be a motherly legislator... She is actually looking at \\nthe needs of our children in school, and that is the core of this nation, both at the present and \\nin the future.   Looking at the Motion, it seeks for the development of a policy. Going by the \\ncontributors who have already contributed ahead of me, this Motion is receiving overwhelming \\nsupport from all the Members who have contributed, I included, because I am supporting it. I \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It comes at a time when the President, His Excellency William \\nSamoei Ruto, pronounced himself yesterday at a function in Eastlands, where he had gone to \\nsee to the needs of the Education Sector. He said that he is committed to double the Feeding \\nProgramme Fund – which now stands at about Ksh2 billion – to Ksh4 billion. This is a Motion \\nthat is already receiving political goodwill. I believe that with the able President we have, it \\nwill be effected, and we will be able to embed it into law.  We shall align it with other needs \\nthat will come with the other laws that we are trying to protect under the Constitution. \\n\\n My colleague the Member for Matungulu,  Hon. Mule and  I, have already  taken the \\nlead, which is receiving an overwhelming support, because it is a common agenda to have the \\nNG-CDF embedded in the Constitution so that busy bodies will never try to distract the funds \\nthat help this country and the children. We believe that with the able President that we have, \\nthis will be effected. So, we should embed it in law and align it with the other needs that will \\ncome with other laws we are trying to protect under the Constitution.  \\n\\nMy colleague  and Member for Matungulu,  Hon. Mule and  I, have already  taken the \\nlead and it is receiving overwhelming support. This is because it is a common agenda to have \\nthe  National  Government  Constituencies  Development  Fund  (NG-CDF)  embedded  in  the \\nConstitution so that busy bodies will never come again to try and divert funds which usually \\nhelp the children of this country. \\n \\nThis  Motion,  if  passed,  will  enable  the  Government  to  set  aside  some  funds  in  the \\nbudgetary allocation under the Ministry of Education. It can well be tied with NG-CDF as a \\nsupplementary component, just like we do in matters of infrastructure, national administration \\nand security, which are under the national Government.  \\n \\nI  believe  Kenyans  should  not  worry  because  the  NG-CDF  Act,  which  was  declared \\nunconstitutional, was the 2013 Act which allowed those funds to be used in any form, including \\nthe  devolved  functions.  In  the  2015  amendments,  the  Fund  was  aligned  with  the  national \\nGovernment functions like education, national Government administration and security. This \\nis exactly what is being done through NG-CDF. If one was to do a proposal that goes against \\nthose lines in matters that are devolved, that proposal cannot pass the board level of NG-CDF. \\n \\nIf this Motion goes through - and I am optimistic it will - if there are any funds that will \\nbe allocated under the program, I propose they should be decentralised to the constituency level \\ninstead of being left at the national level. This is because if those funds are left at the national \\nlevel, there will be scramble for those resources.  \\n \\nOnce it is decentralised at the constituency level, every Member of Parliament knows \\nthe needs of each and every child. Again, this should be capped to the number of children so \\nthat we do not all receive the same amount of money and yet, our needs are different. That is \\nbecause those are funds that will support individual children and not the area. Also, secondary \\nschools  can  benefit  from  this  program  because  basic  education  covers  them.  So,  that  way, \\nsecondary  schools  which  we  have  been  supporting  with  the  feeding  program  can  also  be \\ncovered. \\n \\n \\nFred Ikana, Member for Shinyalu Constituency. \\n \\nHon.

Nataka nilitilie mkazo barabara \\nya kutoka pale kiwanja cha ndege hadi kuingia pale Rondo - Ireo hadi Chepsonoi.

Kamande Mwafrika (Roysambu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker, \\nfor giving me this glorious opportunity to address this House called the National Assembly; \\nformerly the Legislative Council of Kenya (LegCo).  \\n \\nAllow me to start by thanking our Almighty God for giving our country a very peaceful \\nand smooth  transition  during the last  general  elections.  I also  take this opportunity to  thank \\nKenyans for electing my presidential candidate, Dr. William Samoei Ruto, as the 5th President \\nof the Republic of Kenya. I also congratulate the Speaker, Hon. Moses Masika Wetang’ula, \\nand his Deputy for their election in this House. I also wish to congratulate you on the privilege \\nto sit in on their behalf. I would like to most sincerely thank the great people of Roysambu for \\ndemonstrating confidence in me and electing me as their Member of Parliament. God works in \\na  miraculous  way.  This  was  my  fourth  time  to  contest.  The  first  time  I  contested  to  be  a \\ncouncillor  in  Makongeni  in  1992,  I  did  not  win.  I  then  contested  to  be  the  Member  of  the \\nCounty Assembly (MCA) for Githurai and failed. I thought that the seat was too low for me. I \\ndecided to vie for the position of the Member of Parliament. I vied in 2017, but I did not win. \\nI told my predecessor: “You have defeated me in 2017. Find me in 2022.” This time round he \\nvied, but had no otherwise but to give way. I would like to assure the people of Roysambu that \\nI am equal to the task and to the responsibilities that they have bestowed on me.  \\n\\nMhe.

There are parts of Roysambu where if you are blindfolded,  dropped there and asked \\nto say where you are, you would say that you are probably in a constituency in upcountry. In a \\nplace  like  Kahawa  West,  there  are  no  roads.  Places  like  Kiwanja  and  KM  behind  Kenyatta \\nUniversity  (KU)  have  never  been  supplied  with  clean  water.  I  know  that  the  responsibility \\nwhich has been bestowed on me by the Roysambu people is not a walk in the park. But I am \\ndetermined to serve them and to ensure that I take Roysambu to the next level of development. \\nLike any other constituency, Roysambu has its challenges, ranging from infrastructure \\ndevelopment to insecurity. We have a great problem of insecurity in Zimmerman, but we are \\ncurrently talking with security agents and plans are under way to ensure that security in that \\narea is beefed up. \\n\\nTurning  to  today’s  Motion,  I  would  like  to  support  it.  Personally,  I  have  a  very  bad \\nexperience with hunger. I do not know whether there is anybody in this House who has spent \\na night without taking supper, not because you do not have the appetite, but because you have \\nnothing to eat. What happens? Imagine waking up in the morning and there is no breakfast; \\nlunch time comes, there is nothing to eat; at night, there is no supper. It happened to me one \\ntime. After missing breakfast,  I decided to take a cup of hot water at night and thought that \\nwhen I go to bed, I would sleep until morning. When you go to bed when you are hungry, sleep \\ndoes not come. You will be awake the whole night till morning. Some parts of our country are \\nravaged  by  famine  and  hunger.  When  we  in  Nairobi  eat,  we  sometimes  feel  as  if  we  are \\ncommitting a crime considering that there are families and children without food. I support this \\nMotion. I fear that if nothing is done in this regard, many children will drop out of school. So, \\nthis Motion is urgent and something needs to be done before the situation gets out of hand. \\n\\nI thank you. \\n \\n\\n[The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon. \\n\\nDavid Ochieng') left the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon. \\n\\nOmboko Milemba) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon.

I \\n\\nwant to congratulate you and proceed with this debate. \\n\\nI thank Mheshimiwa Elsie for coming up with this Motion that has been on my mind. \\nTwo  days  ago,  I  requested  to  present  this  Motion  and  I  was  told  that  someone  was  already \\nworking on it. I want to congratulate her because this Motion is so timely. \\n\\nSome of us come from areas that are seriously affected by drought. We know what is \\nhappening on the ground. Many children have already dropped out of school. Some of them \\nhave already registered for exams. They are supposed to sit for the exams towards the end of \\nthe year just like any other students in this country. That is why the school feeding policy is \\nquite crucial at this particular time. \\n\\nFrom what Members have shared today, we have heard that most areas, including areas \\nsome of us would not imagine, are experiencing the same challenges. This confirms that there \\nis need for us to have a school feeding programme. As we all know, some families may only \\nafford one meal while others may not even afford a meal today. If the Government was good \\nat planning, we would not be in this situation today. But we are here year-in, year-out, crying \\nand debating about drought and coming up with policies and suggesting good ideas that have \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

If we invest in this school feeding programme, we know very well that \\nthe number of the students that are dropping out of school will reduce, and that the health of \\nour children will improve. We also know that concentration levels will go high. As a result, \\nperformance in end of year exams that are coming will also give us some good results. \\n\\nI  support  the  Motion.  I  donate  the  remaining  time  to  others.  Thank  you,  Hon. \\n\\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon. Omboko Milemba): Thank you for donating \\n\\nAs of today, we are wondering what will happen to students who have no food at home \\nand cannot go to school because schools do not provide. I congratulate our President for giving \\nin  to  those  demands  and  increasing  funds  towards  the  school  feeding  programme.  It  is  my \\nprayer that the implementation will happen soon. \\nI want to donate a bit of my time to others. \\nAs I finish, proper policies should be put in place so that we are guided to not always \\nrush into crisis and be reactive. Right now, we are just reacting to the problems that we are \\nfacing.  \\n \\nI suggest proper monitoring and evaluation to take place after every three years so that \\nthis  House  is  guided  by  the  facts  that  will  be  found.  I  call  upon  the  national  and  county \\ngovernments to give this serious matter proper attention and focus on areas that are seriously \\naffected by drought - that is the northern parts of Kenya and other areas. That is so that we can \\nat least save lives, elevate the lives of our children and take them back to school to sit for their \\nexams. Some supplements may be provided in schools. We call upon the donors who can give \\nthe supplements to school going children to make them energetic enough to do so.  \\n \\nTemporary Deputy Speaker.  \\n \\nsome time to the rest.

It is through hard work, commitment and resilience. I take \\nthis opportunity to thank the people of Kajiado West Constituency, whom I treasure, as well as \\nmy think tank, my wife, the bishops in my constituency, and the pastors and prayer men and \\nwomen  who  have  been  working  very  hard  and  tirelessly  to  deliver  my  victory.  I  also \\ncongratulate you for your election as a member of the Speaker’s Panel.   \\n \\nI thank the five wards from my constituency: the people of Mosiro Ward, Magadi Ward, \\nIloodokilani Ward, Ewaso Kedong’, and more specifically the people of Keekonyokie Ward. \\nThey have elected me as a councillor two terms, one term  as Member of County Assembly \\n(MCA) and these other two terms as a Member of Parliament. With the help of God, I promise \\nto serve them diligently and give my best.  \\n \\nI congratulate His Excellency Dr. William Ruto for being elected as President and for \\nhis support of being a mentor to many out here. I also congratulate his Excellency the Deputy \\nPresident, Rigathi Gachagua, upon his election.  \\n \\nAs an upholder of the bottom-up system, I work as a businessman by selling livestock \\nwithout capital. I urge Kenyans to make ends meet. There is hope and light at the end of the \\ntunnel. I congratulate my Hon. Speaker, Moses Wetang'ula, and the Hon. Deputy Speaker, who \\nare residents of Kajiado West Constituency. The only thing missing there is that they are not \\nregistered as voters in that constituency. I take this time to congratulate the Hon. Speaker, aka \\nPapa wa Roma, who delivered 71 per cent of Kenyans in Bungoma to Kenya Kwanza.  \\n \\nThe speech of His Excellency Dr. William Ruto concerning the allocation of Kshs50 \\nbillion  to  the  Hustler  Fund  will  be  a  tremendous  benefit  to  farmers,  and  small  and  medium \\nenterprises. The people will be able to access affordable credit and expand their businesses as \\nwell  as  leverage  on  technology  in  the  management  and  disbursement  of  the  Hustler  Fund. \\nPresident William Ruto has the heart of transforming this country to  another milestone.

He is a man of his word, he means ‘yes’. If something is possible, he will act - not \\nlike the Kshs6,000 for each family or the handshake government which is from the other side \\nof the story. Those things almost brought this country to a place where we were not expecting. \\nIn my constituency, the issue of water and food security is a big problem. The feeding \\nprogramme, which has been tabled here, needs very urgent attention by this honourable House. \\nIt is a very demanding and pertinent matter that needs a quick response.  \\n\\nSuccessful leaders  – because we are leaders  who Kenyans  are looking up to  –  build \\neach  other.  We  need  to  think  about  this  country,  motivate,  inspire  and  push  each  other. \\nUnsuccessful leaders, on the other hand, just complain,  hate and claim.  I want  to  praise the \\nPresident’s Speech for being elaborate, articulate and precise. I also want to say that the issue \\nof development of the school feeding programme is affecting every Kenyan and our children. \\nMany  children  are  living  without  anything.  We  need  to  take  action  because  many  people \\ndepend on long and short rains. Therefore, we need to declare that the drought is a national \\ndisaster in this country. I would like to take this opportunity to support this Motion and urge \\nthat we take action.  \\n\\nI rest my case and donate some time to other Members. Thank you, Hon. Temporary \\n\\nDeputy Speaker \\n\\nThe  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker  (Hon.  Omboko  Milemba):  Very  well.  The  Hon. \\nMember  is  donating  when  he  has  actually  finished  his  time,  but  I  want  to  encourage  the \\nspeakers who may follow when given a chance, to summarise so that we donate more time. \\nNext is Member of Parliament for Narok South. Proceed.  \\n\\nHon.  Kitilai  ole  Ntuntu  (Narok  South,  Independent):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary \\nDeputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this important Motion that is \\npertaining to the development of a school feeding policy by Hon. Muhanda. Before I go into \\nthat, I would like to salute and appreciate the people of Narok South for sending me to this \\nhonourable House through an independent ticket. It was not an easy task but a big fight. For \\nthe people of Narok South, I would like to say thank you very much.  \\n\\nHon. Temporary Speaker, going into the Motion, I rise to fully support this important \\nMotion  because  coming  up  with  a  clear  legal  framework  that  will  regulate  the  feeding \\nprogramme in our public schools will not only be about the improvement of nutrition intake \\nfor our children, but it will also be the surest way to sustain education of our young learners in \\nKenyan schools. As I speak in this honourable House, many children in Kenya including those \\nfrom Narok South where I represent in this House, are not in school now due to the ongoing \\ndrought as a result of failed rains. The prolonged dry spells and drought, in several parts of this \\ncountry have affected livestock like sheep and cattle in Narok South and Kenya in general, and \\nespecially in Arid and Semi-Arid Land (ASAL) areas. The current drought in Kenya has forced \\nmany pastoralists in Narok South to migrate to very far areas in search of pasture and water for \\ntheir livestock; thus interrupting learners’ educational calendar. The absence of our learners in \\nschool has not only affected their academic performance over the years, but has also made a \\nbig percentage to drop out of schools, especially the girl child. This is due to early pregnancy \\nand marriages.  \\n\\nAccording  to  international,  regional  and  national  focus,  there  is  a  high  likelihood  of \\nbelow average rainfall during the October to December short rains across northern and eastern \\nKenya. Due to this change of climatic conditions globally, we must be prepared for the future \\nof learners by  mitigating the effect  of drought.  If there was  a proper  feeding programme to \\nsustain those kids in school, they would remain in school and learn uninterrupted at all times.  \\nHon. Temporary Speaker, areas of Naroosura, Enkutoto, Loita and Maji Moto are the \\nmain affected areas by drought in Narok South, the constituency which I represent. It is high \\ntime Parliament came up with a school feeding programme that is supported by a clear policy \\nand budgetary framework that is fully anchored in the law. This will go very far in supporting \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Temporary Deputy Speaker for standing in as one of the speakers. I would like \\nto thank the people of Kipkelion East for electing me into this august House. For this reason, I \\nowe them a lot because of what they did to me. It has been a long journey for me as this was \\nmy fourth time to contest and I thank God because it has come to this time that I am actually \\nthe Member of Parliament for Kipkelion East.  \\n\\nI also want to say this about Kipkelion East. This is an area that has been marginalised \\nfor a long time and we have a lot of projects which have stalled. We have roads which have \\nexisted  since  time  immemorial  and  they  have  not  been  tarmacked.  We  have  Furaha-Ilotii-\\nOltopil  road and also  the  Londiani-Makutano  road. Those roads have been there since time \\nimmemorial and they have not been tarmacked. We also have water problems in that area.  \\n\\nHon. Temporary Deputy Speaker, some key issues that we also have in this area and \\nwhich need to be tackled is electricity. The people of Kipkelion East have been looking forward \\nand yearning to have electricity because most homes have not been connected. I want to assure \\nthem that I am ready to work with them hand-in-hand and make sure that most of the homes \\nare connected under the Last Mile Programme.  \\n\\nThey should also get clean water.  Hon. Temporary Deputy Speaker, we  also have a \\nproposed referral hospital in  Londiani, which has taken 12  years without being constructed. \\nThat hospital is supposed to help the people of Londiani and the larger Kericho County. If you \\nsit along Muhoroni road, you will notice many ambulances going to Eldoret that are carrying \\nsick people from our area. I promise the people of Kipkelion that I am going to make sure that \\nthe referral hospital is built.   \\n\\nConcerning  the  issue  of  the  development  of  a  school  feeding  policy,  it  is  a  good \\nprogramme. I thank Hon. Elsie Muhanda for bringing this Motion.  This one has to be handled \\nin a proper way.  Logistics have to be put in place and make sure that the feeding programme \\nis going to be consistent.  By doing so means that we must have proper structures in place so \\nthat our children in school can benefit from this programme. We have to look for long term \\nsolutions so that we may not only do it just for a short while. Therefore, it requires a lot of \\nengagement, especially from the Ministries of Agriculture and Health. Some of the things that \\nmust be considered is the health of our children. That means that hygiene should be practised \\nand make sure that the children get the food at the right time. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Temporary Deputy Speaker. I wish to donate my remaining time to \\n\\nthe rest of the Members. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Temporary Speaker (Hon. \\nOmboko Milemba) left the Chair] \\n\\n[The Temporary Speaker (Hon. \\nDavid Ochieng) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

David Ochieng'): Thank you so much. This \\n\\nchance goes to the Member for Turbo, Hon. Janet Sitienei. \\n\\nHon. (Ms.) Janet Sitienei (Turbo, UDA): Thank you Hon. Temporary Speaker. I was \\nalmost giving up. I wish to take this opportunity to thank you for giving me this chance to add \\nmy  voice  to  this  Motion.  I  congratulate  you  for  meriting  the  Chairperson’s  Panel  and \\ncongratulate the substantive Speaker, Hon. Moses Wetang'ula and the Deputy Speaker Hon. \\nGladys Boss.  I also want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Turbo.  I also thank \\nthe Almighty God for giving me another opportunity to come to this august House.  I thank my \\nfamily led by my husband. I also want to thank the people of Turbo for believing in me again. \\nI  thank  the  people  of  Ngenyilel,  Tapsagoi,  Kamagut,  Kiplombe,  Kapsaos  and  Huruma  for \\nbelieving in me once more.  I pledge to work very hard to ensure that service delivery is up to \\ndate.  \\n\\nI also want to thank the President of the Republic of Kenya because he is a voter in my \\nconstituency and he voted for me; including Her Excellency Rachel Ruto. I want to thank them \\nso much. It is humbling to be voted in by the President.   \\n\\nI want to add my voice to the Motion and thank Hon. Elsie Muhanda for bringing it. It \\nis on the development of a school feeding policy.  It is, indeed, a very important Motion that \\nbrings in the issue of school feeding programme in our schools.  It is very important because \\nthis is the only way to mitigate on hunger and malnutrition in the basic and secondary schools.  \\nGiven  that  4.1  million  people  are  hungry  in  this  Nation,  by  introducing  the  school  feeding \\nprogramme, it is going to go a long way in ensuring that there is increase in enrolment, there \\nwill be improved results in our schools and struggling for 100 per cent transition will be a thing \\nof the past.  It has been so difficult to ensure that schools have 100 per cent transition when \\nfamilies have no food to give to their children.  When some families go hungry in a day, some \\nhave no meal or three meals in a day. So, this will go a long way in ensuring that there is 100 \\nper cent  transition.    It  is  also  going to  help  improve the nutrition  of our children. When we \\nimprove  on  the  nutrition  of  our  children,  we  are  also  improving  on  their  IQ  and  hence,  the \\nresults will even be better. \\n\\nThose of us who were in school in the 1970s never had the school feeding programme. \\nBut for those who joined in the 1980s, I still remember there was something called “SUPRO”. \\nI am sure many of you do not know that. It was a very nice meal that was given to the primary \\nschool children and it enhanced the nutritional value of the children. In the 1990s, came the \\nNyayo  Milk  that  also  enhanced  the  nutrition  of  the  children  then.    We  do  not  know  what \\nhappened. We urge the Government to go back to the shelves.  I believe the policies are still \\nthere and they can dust them and improve on them so that we do not spend more money forming \\ntaskforces to look into the school feeding program.  Those policies are there and we can only \\ndust them, look at them and implement them. \\n\\nI thank God for the new Government, the Kenya Kwanza Government  because they \\nhave  a  plan.  It  is  going  to  be  implemented.  We  saw  our  President  actually  eating  with  the \\nchildren in one of the schools in Nairobi.  That means he wants to support the School Feeding \\nProgramme.  So, I assure Hon. Elsie that this will be done.  For that to happen, we need to do \\na few things. For it to be cost-effective, the Government has to work smart to reduce on the \\neffect of drought and to ensure the country is food secure.  \\n\\nI support this Motion that the school feeding programme be back in our schools. Thank \\n\\nyou for giving me this opportunity. \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. David Ochieng): Thank you very much Member for \\nTurbo.  I just want to request the Members that we could all speak if we mind that we are many \\nand we make our speeches brief.  The next speaker is the Member for Ijara. \\n\\nHon. Abdi Ali Abdi (Ijara, NAP-K): Thank you very much, Hon. Temporary Speaker, \\nfor  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  speak  in  the  13th  Parliament  as  a  new  comer.  For  record \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c13th October 2022                       NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               60 \\n\\npurposes,  my  name  is  Abdi  Ali  Abdi,  MP  IJara  and  the  youngest  party  leader  of  National \\nAgenda  Party  of  Kenya.  The  National  Agenda  Party  of  Kenya  is  a  coalition  partner  in  the \\nKenya Kwanza Alliance. It is the single majority party in the Garissa County Assembly with \\neight Members of the County Assembly (MCAs).  \\n\\nIt  is  with  humility  and  excitement  that  I  make  my  maiden  speech  representing  Ijara \\nConstituency, the jewel of Northern Kenya. I also take this opportunity to thank the Almighty \\nGod  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  be  elected  to  this  august  House  as  the  Member  of \\nParliament for Ijara. It is not easy. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the great \\npeople of Ijara Constituency, my family, the women, friends, youths and the elderly who stood \\nwith me during my campaigns, who showed great confidence in me and voted me in as their \\nMember of Parliament. I am humbled by their firm faith and belief in my ability to represent \\nthem in the august House. I am honoured to serve them as their Member of Parliament. I hope \\nI can repay the faith they have placed in me.  \\n\\nI  also  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  our  President  and  his  Deputy  for  their \\nelection. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Speaker of the National Assembly and \\nthe Deputy Speaker, in absentia, for their election. I also take this opportunity to congratulate \\nyou, Hon. Temporary Speaker, for being appointed to the Speaker’s Panel of the Assembly.   \\nAs you are aware, Ijara is located 100 kilometres away from Lamu and 180 kilometres \\naway from Garissa. It is the home of the Hirola. It is the only place where you will  find the \\nHirola in Kenya. Ijara has many problems. I may not have time to explain all of them in detail, \\nbut I will focus on a few key issues. \\n\\nThere is the issue of roads. We do not have any road network connection in Ijara. The \\nsame  applies  to  electricity.  The  only  place  where  there  is  electricity  is  at  the  constituency \\nheadquarters in Masalani. Other parts of Ijara have no electricity.  \\n\\nThe other issue is insecurity, as we border Somalia. One of my key agenda is to make \\nsure that I deliver, inshallah, and with the help of God, address all these issues. I look forward \\nto opening a border point in Hulugho, which will ease movement of goods and services and, at \\nthe same time, improve on the insecurity that we have there.  \\n\\nThe other issue that I want to push is the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport \\n(LAPSSET) project. LAPSSET is a flagship project. It is a mega project that will open up the \\nmarket  for  Ijara  and  the  entire  Northern  Kenya.  I  request  the  Executive  to  make  sure  that \\nLAPSSET  is  implemented  to  the  letter.  That  is  because  it  will  open  up  opportunities  both \\ninternally and externally.  \\n\\nThe other thing that I am looking forward to is enhancing food security. Ijara is fertile \\n\\nand fit for seasonal farming with the right seedlings and fertilisers.   \\n\\nThe  other  thing  that  I  look  forward  to  addressing  is  education.  The  removal  of \\naffirmative  action  by  the  previous  Government  led  to  poor  performance  of  education  in \\nNorthern Kenya. I appeal to the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to reintroduce affirmative \\naction, which will increase the student-teacher ratio.    \\n\\nOur  country  is  facing  a  historical  drought  with  some  regions,  including  my  own \\nconstituency, not receiving any signs of rainfall for the last four seasons. The drought situation \\nin  my  constituency  is  currently  at  an  alarming  stage  and  is  the  worst  that  has  ever  been \\nwitnessed. The prolonged drought has affected livestock and deteriorated the food situation. \\nThe situation is so bad that last month, a very sad incident happened in my constituency after \\nfour hyenas attacked six of my constituents in Sagar and Warsame, in a case of human-wildlife \\nconflict. Currently, buffalos are dying in mud at a dry water pan in my constituency in a village \\ncalled Karmatha. Due to this failure of rainfall, the condition of our livestock is poor. Water \\npans have dried up. Livestock rely on boreholes, which frequently break down. Livestock do \\nnot fetch any prices and there is no milk available. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I thank His Excellency \\nthe  President  and  the  national  Government  for  the  few  small  interventions  of  marshalling \\nresources  and  releasing  enough  consignments  to  3.5  million  people.  On  behalf  of  my \\nconstituency, I still appeal for more support in upscaling this relief food to more pastoralists to \\nenhance the emergence of cash transfers, animal feeds and provision of water for both humans \\nand livestock.  \\n\\nFellow Hon. Members, while distribution of relief food is important at this moment in \\ntime, it is our mandate, as the 13th Parliament, to engage relevant stakeholders in finding, not \\nonly  urgent  measures  to  protect  our  people  and  their  livelihoods  from  the  effects  of  the \\ndevastating  drought  and  climate  change,  but  also  to  ensure  that  we  provide  sustainable  and \\ncomprehensive solutions of land restoration, which address many of the underlying factors of \\ndegrading water cycles and loss of soil fertility.    \\n\\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. David Ochieng’): Thank you so much. This chance \\n\\ngoes to the Member for Mathioya.  \\n\\nHon.  Edwin  Gichuki  (Mathioya,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker,  for \\n\\ngiving me this opportunity to address the House for a second time. \\n\\nFirst, I support the Motion on the school-feeding policy. The Motion was due. I do not \\nwant to repeat much that has been said by my colleagues, but I would just like to say one thing. \\nEvidence  has  shown  that  because  children  in  boarding  schools  get  all  meals,  including \\nbreakfast, lunch and supper, they perform better than those in day schools, especially those in \\nunder-privileged day schools that do not have access to some of that food.  \\n\\nI would like to maybe suggest one thing. I know the school-feeding programme is a \\nshort-term intervention measure. The key to ensuring that our children survive in schools is to \\nbuild capacity for schools to also produce food. There is one Member who has said that schools \\nhave very big parcels of land, which is true. I remember in the 1990s and 2000s when we were \\nin school, we used to produce our own food. We had cattle and we used to milk the cows for \\nschool milk, tea and other uses.  We used to plant maize, beans and potatoes and the school \\nwas self-sufficient in terms of food.  Looking at the history of this school feeding program, we \\nknow that in the 1980s there was the Maziwa ya Nyayo programme which some of us were also \\nprivileged to be part of in our primary schools.  I think that is why we used to perform better \\ncompared to some of the learners now because as we know milk provides a lot of the nutrients.  \\nThe program was cancelled by the late President Kibaki’s Government because of it cost.  \\n\\n In March 2022, there was an Education  Bill  in  this  House, which was proposing to \\nintroduce free milk in pre- primary school and public primary schools. This House rejected the \\nBill because of the cost.  I looked at the statistics and it was costing Kshs1 billion a week and \\nKshs36 billion annually because out of 53 weeks, I think the school programme is 36 weeks.  \\nTherefore, We need to look at the budget implication so that we do not go through all the stages \\nand  then  realise  there  is  no  budget  to  support  the  program.    With  that,  I  would  also  like  to \\ndonate my time. I fully support this Motion. \\n\\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon. David Ochieng): Thank you so much. I wish \\nall of us could be like the Member for Mathioya.  The next chance goes to the Member for \\nKiambu, Hon. John Waithaka. \\n\\nHon.  John  Waithaka  (Kiambu,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Temporary  Speaker  for \\ngiving me this opportunity to make my maiden speech in this honourable House.  I do not take \\nthis  opportunity  for  granted  and  I  will  always  be  thankful.    My  name  is  Mr  John  Machua \\nWaithaka also known as “Machua Sure Bet”, the Member of Parliament for Kiambu Town. \\nLet me first congratulate the Hon. Speaker, Hon. Moses Wetang'ula and the Deputy Speaker, \\nHon. Boss Shollei, for their election as Speaker and Deputy Speaker respectively, in the 13th \\nParliament.  I sincerely wish them all the best in the task of guiding the proceedings of this \\nHouse. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Temporary  Deputy  Speaker,  let  me  take  this  early \\nopportunity to thank the entire leadership of my Party, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) \\nincluding  His  Excellency  President  Dr.  William  Samoei  Ruto  and  his  Deputy,  Rigathi \\nGachagua for being elected as the 5th President and the Deputy President of the Republic of \\nKenya, respectively.  May the Almighty God give them wisdom in this journey to transform \\nthe country.   \\n\\nIt  is  indeed  a  great  moment  that  I  stand  before  this  House  to  join  my  fellow \\nParliamentarians in  thanking the Almighty God for the favour he has bestowed on us.  It  is \\ndifficult to put into words the enormous pride I feel standing in this Chamber as a representative \\nof the great people of Kiambu. They presented me with this chance to be their voice of reason.  \\nI  take  pride  in  being  elected  as  the  Member  of  Parliament  but  I  feel  humbled  by  the \\nresponsibility it carries.  It is my hope that while in this House,  I will promote constructive \\nsolutions based on equity and social justice for the problems that challenge us today. \\n\\n  Being a new Member of this House is a milestone for me; there is much to say. As my \\nfellow Parliamentarians are aware, the road to Parliament is not a journey that one makes alone.  \\nIt is an effort of family, friends, volunteers, political parties and the voting public.  All have \\ncontributed to making my campaign a success and I sincerely wish to thank them for helping \\nme achieve this position.  I do not take this lightly. I pledge my loyalty to the people of Kiambu \\nand earnestly thank them for putting their trust in me.  Let me assure them that I will be their \\nchampion and will whole heartedly defend their rights and prosperity in this House.   \\n\\nThe promotion of good governance requires a Parliament that can effectively perform \\nthe  functions  of  representation,  oversight  and  law-making.  Our  ability  to  control  public \\nexpenditure  will  be  a  good  service  to  our  people.    The  Kenyan  people  are  looking  up  to \\nParliament and Government for solutions to problems that confront them on a daily basis.  Our \\npeople expect us to help fix the economy, provide jobs for the unemployed and improve access \\nand quality education, healthcare and generally give them hope.   \\n\\nAs to the Presidential Speech, Hon. Temporary Deputy Speaker, let me congratulate \\nour President Dr William Samoei Ruto for his promise to run an administration that is open \\nand transparent.  On my part, I promise His Excellency that I will reciprocate with my oversight \\nmandate  to  make  sure  the  public  gets  value  for  funds  invested  in  various  programmes  and \\npolicies.   \\n\\nDuring  our  campaigns,  the  President  promised  to  create  a  fund  to  assist  Small  and \\nMedium Enterprises (SMEs) to carry out their businesses.  I give the President a thumbs up for \\npromising to allocate Kshs 50 billion every year to the Hustler Fund to enable them expand \\ntheir businesses.  Indeed, the President did not disappoint in his Speech when he said that he \\nwill  make  sure  that  the  hustler  economy  flourishes  and  forms  the  foundation  of  broader \\neconomic transformation.   \\n\\nConcerning  electricity,  we  are  proud  of  the  President  for  promising  to  facilitate  the \\ndevelopment of effective and innovative modalities to provide better-off grid systems including \\nenabling customers to form small co-operatives for that purpose.  On health, the President’s \\nmove to have a universal healthcare reality and liberate Kenyans and their families from the \\nthreat of losing property has also come at the right time.  Every Kenyan should have access to \\ngood healthcare.  Hon. Speaker, the challenges facing Kiambu hospitals are insurmountable \\nand I would like to ask the relevant ministry in collaboration with the county government to \\nintervene and solve the many problems that are facing Level 5 hospitals. \\n\\nJust like other parts of Kenya, Kiambu Constituency has insecurity challenges. We have \\na crime hotspot in my constituency that requires security in line with the Presidential Directive \\nand Speech at the United Nations.  \\n\\nAdditionally,  children,  parents  and  teachers  in  my  constituency  are  in  dire  need  of \\nquality  education.    Kiambu  has  been  affected  by  the  prevailing  drought  which  has  affected \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I would, therefore, request the Government to consider food rations for \\npoor deserving households. While echoing the Presidents’ Address, he emphasized that Kenya \\nshould become  a producer country  because, since time immemorial, the  country  has been  a \\nconsumer nation.  However, with Parliament, the fortunes of our country under his Excellency \\nare set to change and move Kenya to a greater growth. \\n\\nHon.  Speaker,  the  Kiambu-Nairobi  Road  was  earmarked  a  long  time  to  be  a  dual \\ncarriageway  by  the  12th  Parliament.    However,  even  after  public  participation  and  residents \\npaving way for the construction, the construction of the road is yet to start.  We would like the \\nGovernment to pay attention and complete the infrastructure projects.  The traffic congestion \\non the said road is too much and active. Productive Kenyans spend more than 2 hours to cover \\na distance of seven kilometres, thus wasting a lot of manpower, increased fuel consumption \\nand  pollution.    I  would  like  to  also  mention  the  roads  connecting  Kiambu  Road  through \\nThindigwa to Windsor and the road connecting Kamiti through Kiamumbi to Maziwa that need \\nto be done. \\n\\n The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Hon. David Ochieng): Thank you so much, Hon. \\nMember for Kiambu.  I still want to request those who will speak next to take, at least, three \\nminutes each without reading so that we can get time for about five Members to speak.  The \\nnext chance goes to the Member for Nandi Hills, Hon. Benard Kitur.  \\n\\nHon. Bernard Kitur (Nandi Hills, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker for \\ngiving me the chance to contribute to the Motion on the development of a school feeding policy \\nwhich has been sponsored by Hon. Elsie Muhanda. \\n\\nFor the record, this is my maiden speech. This is the first time that I am speaking on the \\nFloor of this House. I am Hon. Bernard Kitur, Member for Nandi Hills. I want to thank the \\nAlmighty God and, more sincerely, the people of Nandi Hills Constituency for electing and \\ngiving  me  the  chance  to  be  their  representative  in  this  august  House  in  the  hotly  contested \\nparliamentary elections. I want to thank the people of Kapchorua, Chepkunyuk, Ollessos and \\nNandi Hills Wards. They did an amazing work by giving me that chance. Definitely, I want to \\nassure them that under my representation, they will have their full share of the national cake.  \\nI  wish  to  also  congratulate  His  Excellency  the  President,  William  Samoei  Ruto,  for \\nbeing  elected  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  (CEO)  of  this  nation.  In  just  a  few  days,  he  has \\ndemonstrated  great  boldness  and  brilliance  in  articulating  macro  solutions  to  the  challenges \\nthat we, as a country, are facing. Despite the fact that Nandi County has never missed to have \\na Member of the Cabinet in the history of this country, I want to thank the President for recently \\nappointing  the  Chief  of  Staff  and  Head  of  Public  Service  from  my  constituency  in  Nandi \\nCounty - Commissioner Felix Kosgei  - who is a very brilliant career professional. We truly \\nappreciate him for that. \\n\\nMy fellow Members, I want to first congratulate all of us on being elected. Secondly, \\nthe seniors or ranking members should not be harsh to some of us. We are speaking for the first \\ntime in this House. We are all indebted to you for mentoring us. Please be kind to us. \\n\\nI  want  to  let the people  of Nandi  Hills Constituency  know briefly some  of the  great \\nchallenges we face. For instance, there is a tarmac road from Emaki to Nandi Hills that is in \\ndeplorable  condition,  despite  the  fact  that  it  cuts  through  the  tea  farm  lands  that  earn  this \\ncountry billions of shillings. It is an eyesore. Being in leadership and Government, I want to \\nassure them that constructing that road is one of the things that I will do to help them.  \\n\\nEqually,  when  the  President  made  a  Speech  here  recently,  he  mentioned  about  the \\ninvestment  in  the  water  sector  where  he  would  raise  Kshs5  billion  through  Public-Private \\nPartnerships (PPP). I want to assure the people of Nandi Hills that I will try as much as possible \\nto see the construction of Keben Dam. That has been a big prayer for the people. When we \\nhave that dam, the entire Nandi County as well as Nandi Hills Constituency will have sufficient \\nwater for irrigation. That rich region will change completely. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

As the \\nPresident made his Speech, the matter of public debt recurred. I want to talk briefly about the \\nhistory of the President’s statement. The public debt of Kenya was Kshs1.9 trillion in 2013. It \\nstands at Kshs8.6 trillion now. This is something that affects all of us. It affects the people of \\nNandi Hills as well. This is a rise of about 353 per cent. When you also look at the borrowing \\nhistory, we had borrowed Kshs261 billion in 2013. It currently stands at Kshs866 billion. That \\nmeans  that  the  debt  interest  has  risen  from  Kshs121  billion  to  Kshs578  billion.  This  is  the \\nlargest expenditure item in our Budget which eclipses even our development spending. I want \\nto also put into record that, indeed, this affects all of us, as a country. It affects the people of \\nNandi Hills, all of us and the cost of doing business in Kenya. \\n\\nThe public debt  rose in  2013 from  42 per cent  to  50 per  cent.  This  has  exposed our \\ncountry to a lot of foreign exchange risks. For instance, I understand that between June 2021 \\nand  June  2022,  our  external  debt  rose  by  Kshs290  billion  without  borrowing  even  a  single \\nshilling from abroad. This is because every time there is a depreciation of the shilling by Kshs1, \\nwe  lose  Kshs40  billion.  For  that  reason  and  for  the  sake  of  the  economy  of  this  country,  I \\nsupport the President when he said that we cut down our recurrent expenditure in three years, \\nso that we may have an expenditure surplus. As Parliament, we should speed up to revise the \\ncurrent Budget to ensure that there is no borrowed money that ends up in recurrent expenditure. \\nI am just saying this because it is something that affects us, as a country. \\n\\nSecondly, Hon. Temporary Speaker, I want to touch and give my views on the Hustler \\nFund because most of the people in Nandi Hills are hustlers. This is a matter that they are very \\nkeen to listen to. It is a dream that we have harboured. I support the President when he said that \\nhe would implement it in the best way using technology. This is highly welcome, so that it does \\nnot go the way of the Youth Enterprise Development Fund where almost 60 per cent of the \\nfunds are in default. I also propose to have a Business Hustler Fund within the Hustler Fund \\nwhich  will  be  strictly  based  on  merit.  Till  or  pay  bill  numbers  will  be  used  to  look  at  the \\ntransaction  history  of  the  businesses.  They  will  work  together  with  the  telecommunication \\ncompanies. That will bring money that can circulate. So, I support the President’s move. \\n\\nLastly, I want to also thank the President on matters of Credit Reference Bureau (CRB). \\nHe has helped about 4 million Kenyans to be removed from CRB. It is a very retrogressive, \\nrepressive, punitive and insensitive financial.... \\n\\nThe  Temporary  Deputy  Speaker  (Hon.  David  Ochieng’):  Thank  you  very  much, \\nMember for Nandi Hills. I will give this chance to Hon. Julius Rutto who will be last to speak \\non  this  particular  Motion.  I  am  so  sorry  to  the  other  Members.  This  is  because  of  the  time \\nconstraints and pressure in this particular Motion. \\n\\nHon. Julius Rutto (Kesses, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Temporary Speaker. First of all, \\nallow  me  to  congratulate  you  on  being  among  the  few  selected  Members  to  sit  in  the \\nChairperson’s panel.  \\n\\nI want to support the Motion on the development of a school feeding policy. I want to \\npoint out my support to Article 10 of the Constitution. This issue that we are discussing today \\nought to have been taken care of if, at all, we had implemented the spirit of the Constitution. \\nArticle 10 (2) of the Constitution says that the national values and principles of governance \\ninclude— \\n \\ndemocracy and participation of the people;  \\n \\nnon-discrimination and protection of the marginalised; \\nWe should implement the Constitution as it is. I want to talk about where I come from. \\n \\nI am a product of the Nyayo era. When there was a Nyayo Day, it would be in school. What am \\n\\n(a)  patriotism,  national  unity,  sharing  and  devolution  of  power,  the  rule  of  law, \\n\\n(b) human dignity, equity, social justice, inclusiveness, equality, human rights,  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The constant experience of absenteeism that we see in our areas is contributed \\nmajorly by the lack of food and poor households’ earnings.  \\n\\nI  come  from  Eldoret.  I  am  a  Member  of  Parliament  for  Sekunanga  and  Racecourse \\nSlums. Racecourse Primary School has a population of more than 10,000 pupils. However, in \\nany given day, more than 200 pupils are always absent. Where do they go? They beg in the \\nstreets looking for food to provide for their households. We need to address these challenges \\nonce and for all. It is high time that both levels of Government, devolved and national, allocated \\nmore resources into it and plan around it. This is the composite approach that we need to look \\ninto.  \\n\\nI know that most of the county governments are busy making their county integrated \\ndevelopment plans. The national Government is also focusing on the integrated development \\nplans. It is high time we have a serious discussion on this. In the same spirit, the President tells \\nus to focus on our productivity vis-a-vis our consumption. When we put more energy in our \\nproduction area and then we support our school-going children, we will support agriculture and \\nthe farmers. At the end of the day, we will use one stone to kill two birds: build up our economy \\nand sort out food security.  \\n\\nWhen you look at the budget structure of our country, matters of national interest fail \\nto  touch  on  food  security.  It  focuses  on  weapons,  which  is  national  security.  We  should \\nconsider  threat  to  food  security  as  a  security  matter  in  the  same  way  we  look  at  national \\nsecurity. We should allocate resources where it deserves. When we have enough production, \\nespecially local production with the cheap labour and cost of production, the cost of providing \\nfood to children will come down. If we have deficiency of nutrients, it then means we will have \\nsickness.  \\n\\nFinally, I would have wished to respond to my brother, the Member for Embakasi West. \\nHe said that they are looking upon this Government to bring down the cost of living. It is hardly \\na month since the new Administration took over. Hon. Raila Odinga, with due respect, kindly, \\nallow the current Administration to sort out the problems that they inherited from the previous \\n“handshake” regime where the cost of living rose up because of poor prioritisation and decision \\nmaking.  Allow  this  Administration  to  cure  the  problems  and  focus  on  how  to  address \\npermanent  perennial  challenges  by  sorting  out  the  real  problem;  and  not  massaging,  but \\nsurgering them out, to ensure we  once and for all cure  the living cost.  \\n\\nThank you so much for allowing me this opportunity. \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. David Ochieng’): Thank you so much, Member for \\n\\nKesses.  \\n\\nThat marks the end of debate on this Motion; and like I said, I apologise to Members \\nwho were not able to speak. Next time, they will have an opportunity to do so. The Mover of \\nthis Motion would be asked to reply to it next time.  \\n\\nHon. Members pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order No.28(3), regarding the \\nCalendar of the Assembly, and resolutions of the House on Wednesday 12th October 2022, the \\nSpeaker notifies that upon the rise of the House at the appointed time today, Regular Sittings \\nwill resume on Tuesday, 25th October 2022 at 2:30 p.m. \\n\\nADJOURNMENT \\n\\n \\nThe Temporary Speaker (Hon. David Ochieng’):  There being no other business, and \\nthe time being 9.11 p.m., this House, stands adjourned until Tuesday, 25th October 2022, at \\n2.30 p.m. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe House rose at 9.11 p.m. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.
